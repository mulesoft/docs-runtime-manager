These are some of the possible errors you might encounter when attempting to attach to a transit gateway.

== Unable to Attach to a Transit Gateway

If you see the `Resource Share Not Found` error when attempting to attach to the 
transit gateway:

. Verify that the *ID* and *Owner* values that you specified are correct. 
. Verify that the region matches the transit gateway region.
. Click the pencil icon to edit these values.

== Unable to Delete a Transit Gateway

If the *Transit Gateways* page doesn't list any VPCs, but you can't delete the transit gateway and you see the `Can't remove this transit gateway` error,
the transit gateway might be attached to a VPC that belongs to another business group that you don't have access to.

== Unable to View a Transit Gateway

Runtime Manager always adds transit gateways at the root business group level.
To view a transit gateway, you need CloudHub Network Viewer permission.

== Unable to Modify a Transit Gateway

To modify a transit gateway, you need CloudHub Network Admin permission.


== Transit Gateway Status is Unknown

If the status for the transit gateway is `Unknown`, the resource share on AWS has been either disabled or deleted.

Click the *View on AWS* button on the *Transit Gateways* page to resolve the issue on AWS:

== VPC Attachment Rejected

If you see the `The attachment was rejected in AWS` error when attempting to attach the VPC to the transit gateway, remove the VPC and reattach it.

See xref:tgw-manage-arm.adoc#remove-an-anypoint-vpc-from-the-transit-gateway[Remove an Anypoint VPC from the Transit Gateway].


== Subnet Already Added to the Route Table

If you see the `This subnet has already been added to this route table` error, add a different
subnet to the table.

== Invalid CIDR Subnet

If you see the `Please enter a single subnet in CIDR notation` error, check that the subnet is in the correct CIDR format.

== Attach VPC Button Is Disabled

If the *Attach VPC* button is disabled, all the VPCs you have access to are already attached to the transit gateway.

== Connections Limit Has Been Reached

If you see an error such as `Connections limit has been reached (max=4, used=4) for the organization`, you have consumed all your network connections entitlements (VPC/VPN licenses).
Contact your account team to purchase additional licenses.
