Anypoint Platform provides a scripting and command-line tool for both Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition (Anypoint Platform PCE).
The command-line interface (CLI) supports both the interactive shell and standard CLI modes and works with:

* xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange]
* xref:access-management::index.adoc[Access management]
* xref:index.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Manager]
+
Use Runtime Manager to manage Mule applications deployed to CloudHub (hosted by MuleSoft) and locally hosted Mule servers.

* xref:design-center::index.adoc[Design Center]

== Prerequisites

* Download and install NodeJS and npm (node package manager) on your system.
+
See the https://nodejs.org/en/download/[NodeJS download page].
* Download and install the Git version management on your system.
+
See the https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git download site].


== Installation

Depending on the configuration of your system, you might need to run these commands using administrator credentials.

[source,text,linenums]
----
$ npm install -g anypoint-cli@latest
----

If the installation command fails with the following error, ensure that the Git client is installed on your computer and the git protocol is not blocked by your firewall or network:

[source,text,linenums]
----
fatal: read error: Invalid argument
----

If the git protocol is blocked, you can configure Git to use `https://` instead of `git://`:

[source,text,linenums]
----
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
----

== Authentication

You can configure Anypoint CLI authentication with username and password, client ID and client secret, or a bearer token.
At least one method is required.

=== Username and Password

If you don't log in using single sign-on (SSO), you can use your username and password to log into the CLI directly.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
| Parameter | Description
| `username` | Your Anypoint Platform username

You can also pass this value using the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_USERNAME=<name>`.
| `password` | Your Anypoint Platform password

You can also pass this value using the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_PASSWORD=<pwd>`.
|===

For information about logging in using SSO, see xref:access-management::external-identity.adoc[About Identity Management].

=== Client ID and Client Secret

You can configure a Connected App with the `client_credentials` grant type to use with the CLI.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
| Parameter | Description
| `client_id` | The ID of the Connected App

You can also pass this value using the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>`.
| `client_secret` | The client secret of the Connected App

You can also pass this value using the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>`.
|===

For more information about Connected Apps, see xref:access-management::connected-apps-overview.adoc[Connected Apps].

=== Bearer Token

If you have already generated a bearer token, you can pass it to the CLI directly.
When you provide a bearer token, the CLI ignores any provided user or client credentials.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
| Parameter | Description
| `bearer` | A bearer token for the Anypoint Platform

Your CLI session expires when the bearer token expires.
|===

For information about generating a bearer token, see https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-to-generate-your-Authorization-Bearer-token-for-Anypoint-Platform[How to generate your Authorization Bearer token for Anypoint Platform].


== Reference

The Anypoint CLI takes the following optional arguments:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
| `organization` | Your organization within Anypoint Platform

You can also pass this value using the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_ORG=<name>`.

| `environment` | Your Anypoint Platform environment

You can also pass this value using the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_ENV=<name>`.

| `host` | The host of your Anypoint Platform Installation +
By default, this value points to `\https://anypoint.mulesoft.com`. +

* If you are using Anypoint Platform PCE, pass the address where you are hosting the platform.
* If you are using Anypoint Platform EU Cloud, pass your EU control plane URL.

You can also pass this value using a dedicated environment variable `ANYPOINT_HOST=<name>`.

|===

== Usage

Keep the following in mind while using the Anypoint CLI:

. Environment variables override credentials file parameters and command-line parameters override environment variables. +
If you don't pass a command-line parameter, the default profile properties are used.
. If not specified, the default environment is production.
+
. Your Anypoint session expires based on the *Default session timeout* configured in your Master Organization settings.
+
For information about Master Organization settings, see xref:access-management::organization.adoc#manage-the-master-organization-s-settings[Manage Master Organization Settings].
. The Anypoint CLI works with autocomplete.
+
You can start typing the name of the command or parameter and press Tab for autocomplete or press Tab+Tab for a list of options.


=== Credentials File

The recommended way of passing these options to your Anypoint Platform CLI installation is using the `credentials` file located inside the `~/.anypoint` directory, which is not automatically created during installation. Follow these steps to create your credentials file:

. Create a directory called `.anypoint` in the `~/` directory for Linux and OSx, or `C:\Users\USERNAME \` in Windows.
. Navigate to your `.anypoint` directory and create a blank file named `credentials` with the following structure:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
{
 "default": {
  "username": "yourAnypointUserName",
  "password": "yourAnypointPassword",
  "organization": "",
  "environment": "",
  "host": ""
 },
 "otherProfile": {
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "organization": "",
  "environment": "",
  "host": ""
 },
 "connAppProfile": {
  "client_id": "",
  "client_secret": "",
  "organization": "",
  "environment": "",
  "host": ""
 }
}
----
Note that the `default` profile is used unless the `ANYPOINT_PROFILE` environment variable is set:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
> export ANYPOINT_PROFILE="otherProfile"
> anypoint-cli
----

Then run the `anypoint-cli` command without any options:

[source,text,linenums]
----
> anypoint-cli
----

=== Dedicated Environment Variables

If you choose to pass the credentials when running `anypoint-cli`, pass both parameters as environment variables: `ANYPOINT_USERNAME` and `ANYPOINT_PASSWORD`.

[source,text,linenums]
----
> export ANYPOINT_USERNAME="username"
> export ANYPOINT_PASSWORD="password"
> anypoint-cli
----

=== CLI Options

If you pass only your username, the Anypoint CLI prompts for your password.

[source,text,linenums]
----
> anypoint-cli --username="user"
Password: ****
----

=== Pass Commands

After setting up a proper way to access Anypoint Platform from the CLI, you can start passing commands. +
See xref:anypoint-platform-cli-commands.adoc[Anypoint Platform CLI 3.x List of Commands] for instructions on how to use them.

=== Use Anypoint CLI Through a Network Proxy

To use the Anypoint CLI through a proxy server, configure the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables with the hostname or IP addresses of your proxy servers.

Depending on your operating system, use the following commands:

* Linux, macOS, or Unix
+
--
`$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://__proxy-server__:80`

`$ export HTTPS_PROXY=https://__proxy-server__:443`
--

* Windows
+
--
`> set HTTP_PROXY=http://__proxy-server__:80`

`> set HTTPS_PROXY=https//__proxy-server__:443`
--

If the proxy server requires authentication, use these commands:

* Linux, macOS, or Unix
+
--
`$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://__username__:__password__@__proxy-server__:80`

`$ export HTTPS_PROXY=https://__username__:__password__@__proxy-server__:443`
--

* Windows
+
--
`> set HTTP_PROXY=http://__username__:__password__@__proxy-server__:80`

`> set HTTPS_PROXY=https://__username__:__password__@__proxy-server__:443`
--
