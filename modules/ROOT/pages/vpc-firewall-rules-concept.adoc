In CloudHub's default configuration, all applications are hosted in a multi-tenant cloud balanced by a publicly accessible load balancer. +
When you create a virtual private cloud (VPC), you can add your own firewall rules to allow specific IP ranges and ports to reach your workers. See <<configurefirewall,Configure Firewall Rules>>.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that the firewall rules that you configure in your VPC check inbound connections only to your workers, and not to the VPC, your dedicated load balancer, or the publicly accessible load balancer.
====

By default, all traffic to your VPC is blocked, unless it's explicitly allowed in a firewall rule.
When you create a VPC, four firewall rules are created by default:

* Two rules to allow inbound connections from within your local VPC through ports 8091 and 8092:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "CIDR Block": "10.111.0.0/24", // (Local VPC)
  "Protocol": "TCP",
  "From port": 8092,
},

{
  "CIDR Block": "10.111.0.0/24", // (Local VPC)
  "Protocol": "TCP",
  "From port": 8091,
},
----
+
These firewall rules allow traffic from within the VPC to reach your workers through ports 8091 and 8092. These are the only ports used by your CloudHub-dedicated load balancer to proxy all external communications to your workers.

* Two rules to allow inbound connections from anywhere through ports 8081 and 8082:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "CIDR Block": "0.0.0.0/0", // (Anywhere)
  "Protocol": "TCP",
  "From port": 8082,
},

{
  "CIDR Block": "0.0.0.0/0", // (Anywhere)
  "Protocol": "TCP",
  "From port": 8081,
}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
These rules allow traffic from any host to reach your workers through ports 8081 and 8082.
These ports are used by CloudHub's shared load balancer to proxy external requests to your workers.
You can remove these rules if you don't want your internal workers to be reached by the publicly accessible load balancer.

== Configure Firewall Rules
You can configure firewall rules in the Anypoint Runtime Manager UI at the time you create a VPC, or you can add them to an existing VPC. You can also modify the firewall rules for a VPC at any time.

Before you implement firewall rules, or make changes to existing rules, you should fully understand all security implications. Make sure you follow the established best practices of your organization before making any changes to firewall rules. In general, the rules you use to define access to your VPC should be as specific as is practical.

Firewall rules are inbound and use the following parameters:

* *Type*: Protocol type, for example, TCP
* *Source*: Source IP address
* *Port Range*: The only two ports exposed externally are 8081 (http.port) and 8082 (https.port). You can use this parameter to open additional ports inside the VPC.

=== Add or Edit Firewall Rules

. Sign into Anypoint Platform as a user with the Organization Administrators role.
. In *Management Center*, click *Runtime Manager*.
. If you already have a VPC:
.. In the left menu, click *VPCs* and click the row for the VPC to configure the firewall rules for. +
The right panel displays information about the VPC.
.. Click *Manage VPC*, then click the *Firewall Rules tab*.
. If you are creating firewall rules when you create your VPC:
.. Click *Firewall Rules >* to expand the fields. +
+

+
. To edit a rule, select the new values from the *Type* and *Source* drop-down lists, and enter the value for the *Port Range*.
. To add additional rules:
.. Click *Add New Rule*.
.. Select the following values for the type and source in the corresponding columns: +
* *Type*: Select the transport protocol type for the rule.
* *Source*: Select the source IP address, or select *Custom* to define your own source.
.. Enter a value for *Port Range* and click *Add to list*.
. To delete a firewall rule, hover over the firewall rule row to delete, then click the trashcan icon in the far-right column. +

[NOTE]
--
No confirmation dialog appears when you delete a firewall rule, so make sure you really want to delete it.
