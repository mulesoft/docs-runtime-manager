When you create a dedicated load balancer (DLB), you must add at least one certificate.
You can add additional certificates to a DLB using Runtime Manager or the command-line interface.

The certificate must be contained in one unencrypted, PEM-encoded file.
If you are migrating a certificate created with Windows tools:

* Remove all "Bag Attributes" and "Key Attributes".
* Convert all end-of-line characters from `\r\n` to `\n`, if necessary.

This file must contain the entire certificate chain ordered sequentially:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Certificate | Example
| The Primary Certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- +
(Your Primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt) +
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
| The Intermediate Certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- +
(Your Intermediate certificate: DigiCertCA.crt) +
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
|===

You don't need to include the root certificate in the certificate chain.
However, ensure that you include the ASCII armor in each certificate.


== Add a Certificate to an Existing Load Balancer

You can add a certificate to an existing DLB using Runtime Manager or the command-line interface.

To add a certificate using Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Load Balancers*, and then click the load balancer name.
. In the *Certificates* tab, click *Add certificate*.
+
.The arrow shows the *Add certificate* option in the *Certificates* tab.

. Select *Choose File* to upload the public key and private key files, such as:

** Public key file
+
A PEM file that includes both the server certificate and the intermediate CA certificate,
for example, `example-com-crt.pem`
** Private key file
+
--
A PEM file that contains a passphrase-less private key, for example, `example-com-private-noencrypt.pem`

To create the passphrase-less file, run a command like the following:

[source,console,linenums]
----
openssl rsa -in example-com-private.pem -out example-com-private_noencrypt.pem
----
--
. Click *Save Certificate*.

To add a certificate to an existing DLB using the CLI:

[source,console,linenums]
----
cloudhub load-balancer ssl-endpoint add myLB_name example-com-crt.pem example-com-private.pem
----


== Replace a Certificate on an Existing Load Balancer

You can replace a certificate on an existing DLB when the certificate is expiring or needs to be updated.

To replace a certificate using Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Load Balancers*, and then click the load balancer name.
. In the *Certificates* tab, click the certificate name.
. Select *Choose File* to upload the public key and private key files, such as:

** Public key file
+
A PEM file that includes both the server certificate and the intermediate CA certificate,
for example, `new-example-com-crt.pem`

** Private key file:
+
--
A PEM file that contains a passphrase-less private key, for example, `new-example-com-private-noencrypt.pem`

To create the passphrase-less file, run a command like the following:

[source,console,linenums]
----
openssl rsa -in new-example-com-private.pem -out new-example-com-private_noencrypt.pem
----
--
. Click *Done Editing*.
. Click *Apply Changes*.
