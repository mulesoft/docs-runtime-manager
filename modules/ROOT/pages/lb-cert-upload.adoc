= About Uploading Certificates to a Dedicated Load Balancer

The certificate that you upload to your load balancer must be contained in one PEM encoded and unencrypted file.
This file must contain the entire certificate chain ordered sequentially, as shown in this example:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Certificate | Example
| The Primary Certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- +
(Your Primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt) +
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
| The Intermediate Certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- +
(Your Intermediate certificate: DigiCertCA.crt) +
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
|===

It is not required to include the root certificate in the certificate chain. However, you must include the ASCII armor in each certificate.


When creating a load balancer, you can include an SSL Endpoint using Runtime Manager or using the `cloudhub load-balancer create` command from the CLI.

After creating a load balancer, you can upload an SSL Endpoint using Runtime Manager or using the `cloudhub load-balancer ssl-endpoint add` command from the CLI.
