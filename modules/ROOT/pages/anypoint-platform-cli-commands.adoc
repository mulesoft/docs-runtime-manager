[TIP]
--
The Anypoint Platform CLI provides three default options:

* The `--help` option displays usage information of the command.
* The `-o` or `--output` option lets you specify the command's output to the defined format. +
Supported values are `table`, `text`, and `json`. Defaults to `text` for non-interactive mode and `table` for interactive sessions.
* The `-f` or `--fields` option allows you to define which fields to output. +
You can pass the `--fields` option after a command to get a list of all possible fields to output.
