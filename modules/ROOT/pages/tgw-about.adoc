_AWS Transit gateway_ acts as a Cloud router, it simplifies network access between VPCs, On-prem or 3rd party software while providing increased visibility and control over the network. Transit Gateways effectively merge an organizationâ€™s cloud resources and on-prem datacenters into one network topology.

On CloudHub you can take advantage of this network simplification by securely attaching an Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to your an AWS Transit Gateway in your AWS account.

You can add multiple transit gateways to your Anypoint Platform organization. The number of transit gateways you can add depends on the transit gateway entitlements available to your account. 
Contact your MuleSoft account representative if you don't know how many entitlements are associated with your account. 

=== Limitations

The following limits are governed by AWS limits:

- maximum number of Transit Gateways per VPC
- maximum number of VPC that you can attach to a Transit Gateway.

For information about limitations when attaching a VPC to a transit gateway, 
see 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html[Transit gateway attachments to a VPC^] in the AWS documentation.
