If your local infrastructure includes Pivotal Cloud Foundry spaces, you can deploy Mule applications to virtual servers running on dynamically allocated local resources. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategies] for a better understanding of how this works and its current limitations.

Through Pivotal Cloud Foundry, you can also xref:1.x@api-manager::setting-up-an-api-proxy.adoc[deploy a proxy application] that can mediate all of the traffic going to a non-Mule app, and through that apply runtime policies.

This page describes the options on the *Deploy Application* panel on the Runtime Manager UI on the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

== Accessing the Deploy Application Screen

To deploy an application:

. Sign on to the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] or click *Sign up* on the sign on page.
. Hover your mouse over the *Runtime Manager* icon and click it, or click *Open*.

. Click *Deploy application*:
+
image::deploying-to-cloudhub-3dcbb.png[]
+
.  The Deploy Application page opens:
+
image::deploying-to-pcf-start.png[]


== Creating an Application Name

Every application requires a unique application domain name. The application domain identifies your application in the Runtime Manager.

In the *Deploy Application* dialog, enter a unique application name. Valid names contain alphanumeric characters and dashes, and contain at most 42 characters. If the name is valid, the Runtime Manager alerts you whether it is available or already reserved by another user.

== Deployment Target

The *Deployment Target* field lets you specify where you want to deploy your application:

* On the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
* On an on-premises server, server group, or cluster

This document focuses on deploying to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, for more information on deploying to servers, server groups and clusters, see xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[Deploying to Your Own Servers].



== Application File

Upload a new file for deployment. Click the *Choose file* button, select your application file, and then click *Open*.

*Note*: The application file size limit is 90 MB.


image::applicationfile.png[ApplicationFile]


== Application Configuration

=== Runtime Version

Using the drop-down menu, select the *Runtime version* (Mule version) to which you wish to deploy:

image::runtimeversion2.png[RuntimeVersion2]

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure that the Mule version is the same version used to develop your application.

* To see what Mule version you set when you deployed your application, click the *Applications* tab and click your application. In the expansion view on the right, click *Manage Application*. Click *Settings* to see the deployment values.
====

=== Replication Factor


Through this field, you can set on how many instances to deploy your application. What each of these instances represents in terms of actual computing power is something that depends on your specific PCF configuration.

image::deploying-to-pcf-repli.png[]


When assigning multiple instances to an application, all of your instances are accessed via a single load balancer. This load balancer is automatically created by PCF and distributes the incoming traffic amongst them.

[NOTE]
Note that if you want your multiple instances to communicate with each other as a cluster, you must <<Binding to Hazelcast, bind them to a Hazelcast server>>.


== Properties Tab

You can also optionally specify properties that your application requires. This allows you to externalize important pieces of configuration which may switch depending on the environment in which you're deploying. For example, if you're using a Mule application in one environment, you might configure your database host to be localhost. But if you're using it on a different environment, you might configure it to be an Amazon RDS server.


To add an application property, click the *Properties* tab then add a key/value pair to the text box using the following format:

----
-Dkey=value
----

The `-D` flag is required to indicate that this is as system property that can be recognized within a Mule application. After adding your property, click *Apply Changes*.

image::deploying-to-pcf-properties.png[]


=== Overriding Properties

Just like with CloudHub and on-premise Mule runtime deployments, applications that you deploy to PCF can still bundle their own property placeholder or secure property placeholder files inside the deployable archive file. Mule substitutes these properties into the application when the application starts.


If you have any property names set in a mule-app.properties file inside your application or in bundled property placeholder files, then when your application is deployed, any entries in the Properties tab with the same name will override the matching value bundled with the application.

////
[NOTE]
It is possible to change the behavior of the application to not allow CloudHub properties to override properties bundled with the deployable archive. You do this by changing options in the Property Placeholder element in the Mule application. See http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.html[Spring documentation on Property Placeholder options] for more information on non-default property placeholder options.
////

////
==== Overriding Secure Properties

Note that you can flag application properties as secure so that their values are not visible to users at runtime or passed between the server and the console. You can also include an 'applications.properties' file in your application bundle, which can include properties that are marked as secure, and they will be automatically treated as such. These properties can also be overriden by new values you can set via the Runtime Manager console at runtime. See xref:secure-application-properties.adoc[Secure Application Properties] for more information.
////


== Service Bindings Tab

You can bind any external service you want to your deployment, and populate this binding with properties that are sent to this service. You could for example bind a database service to your deployment so that the (already existing) database server creates a database instance to match your deployed application. In that case, you'd probably need to send credentials to your database service, and you can send these through properties that are specific to that service binding.

On your Pivotal Operations Manager you can register different applications to make available as services. For example you can have multiple instances of Hazelcast or MySQL registering each to a different database server. Once these are registered, you'll be able to see them displayed on the Runtime Manager UI when you open the *Select a Service* dropdown menu:

image::deploying-to-pcf-services.png[]

After selecting one, click the *Add Service* button. You can then add properties that are specific to the service.


=== Properties for Service Bindings

Just as in the *Properties* tab, you can define `key:value` pairs for properties that are specific to the corresponding service. Keep in mind that the properties on this tab only act on the scope of the given service; the properties on the *Properties* tab act at a global level over the full deployment.

[#Binding to Hazelcast]
=== Binding to Hazelcast

If you're deploying your app to multiple instances (by setting the <<Replication Factor>> field) and you want these instances to communicate with each other as a cluster, you must bind them to a Hazelcast service (or several, one service per Hazelcast instance).


You must first make the service available, by following the steps in xref:1.5@anypoint-platform-pcf::pcf-mule-hazelcast.adoc[To Configure a Mule Hazelcast Server].

Once it's available, you should be able to see it on a drop down in the <<Service Binding Tab>> and you can simply bind your application to this service through the UI. Remember to bind the application to all of the Hazelcast node services you need.

The Mule buildPack will automatically recognize the binding between the Mule application and the Hazelcast cluster and will start the Mule server in cluster mode.

To scale Mule applications that are already deployed, just set the <<Replication Factor>> field. The new Mule nodes will be binded to the same services as the rest. Take into account that by scaling your Mule application you could be imposing too much on your Hazelcast cluster and might have to scale that as well.

////
in case the UI doesn't serve for binding Hazelcast:

To scale Mule applications that are already deployed, just use the cf scale command as you would do usually with any other application.

////

=== Verify Successful Binding

To verify that your service binding was successful, tail the logs of the application after pushing it to PCF and you should find similar entries in the log:

----

== Deployment Execution

After you complete the above steps, click *Create* and PCF creates the necessary virtual resources, loads an image onto them that includes a Mule Runtime instance and then deploys your application to this Mule Runtime.

[NOTE]
This step might take several minutes, as PCF needs to first instance the images.


When deployment is complete, the application status indicator changes to green and you are notified in the logs that the application has deployed successfully. Here's what is in the logs:

----
Successfully deployed [mule application name]
----

== Configuring a Deployed Application


All of the settings discussed in the steps above can be edited once the application is already deployed. To do so you must:


. In the Applications tab, select an application entry and click *Manage Application*:
+
image::amc-manageapplication.png[AMC_ManageApplication]
+
. You should now see the *Settings* tab for the application:
+
image::deploying-to-pcf-setup.png[]


== Auto-Deploy a Proxy from API Manager


If you want to register an API in API Manager for an application that isn't developed as a Mule application, you can do this through the command line.

This creates a simple Mule application that works as a proxy, and that's automatically registered both in the Runtime Manager and in the API Manager. Through the API Manager, you can apply xref:1.x@api-manager::applying-custom-policies.adoc[policies] and view usage data.

image::infrastructure-pcf-api.png[API PCF]

See xref:1.x@api-manager::setting-up-an-api-proxy.adoc[Setting Up a Proxy].


== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to `Failed`. You are alerted in the status area that an error occurred. Check the log details for any application deployment errors. You need to correct the error, upload the application, and deploy again.
