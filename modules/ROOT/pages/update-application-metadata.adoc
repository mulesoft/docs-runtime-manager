[TIP]
This document deals with calling the xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The PUT method, specified with the `/api/applications/{domain}` resource (where `{domain}` is the application domain), updates your application metadata, including the number of workers and system properties. You can also use it to update an existing application. For information on how to update you application, see xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[Updating Your Application].

The update operation can update the workers, properties, muleVersion, and filename properties. Properties which are not specified are not updated.
