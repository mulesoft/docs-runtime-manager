[NOTE]
To view dashboards, your user must have *Read Application* or *Read Servers* permission for the desired resources.

The Dashboard gives you in-depth visibility into usage metrics about both your deployed applications and the systems they're deployed to.

The Dashboard helps you answer questions about your integrated apps, such as:

* When did peaks in usage occur?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on response time?
* How well is the processing power behind my app coping with these peaks?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on message fail rate?
* What impact do high traffic peaks of other applications running on the same server have on the performance of a given application?

Using the *Dashboard*, you can view the evolution of metrics about your apps. Going further, you can drill down to the xref:insight.adoc[Insight] section of each app to investigate the fate of individual transactions to help you analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures.

== The Dashboard for Apps on CloudHub

=== Access the Dashboard

To access a CloudHub app's dashboard:

image::dashboards-a2810.png[]
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left.

=== Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard shows graphs for three separate metrics:

* Mule messages
* CPU usage, as a percentage of the capacity
* Memory usage

All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

image::dashboards-a7117.png[]

If your application runs on multiple workers at a time, they will be charted as different curves on the same graphs, differentiated by different colors.

By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

To access the dashboard of an on-premises app:

. Select an application in the *Applications* page to open the side panel.
. Click the *Manage Application* button.
+
image::dashboards-a2810.png[]
+
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left.

You can also drill down to this dashboard if you first open the dashboard for a server that runs the application, then click on the hyperlink on the name of the application.

=== Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard shows graphs for three separate metrics:

* Mule messages
* Error rate
* Response time

image::monitoring-dashboards-f8368.png[]

All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cbd92.png[]

If your application runs on a cluster or server group, the aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included will be charted as a single plot line.

[TIP]
If you run your app on a cluster or server group and want to see these same metrics broken down at individual server level, you can look at the dashboard for the individual server. Note that if multiple apps are running on the server, what you'll see is the overall server performance, without a distinction between each of the apps running on it.

By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay displays numerical detail about activity on that instance.

image::monitoring-dashboards-fad4e.png[]

[TIP]
Set up xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc#conditions-on-locally-deployed-applications[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.

== The Dashboard for a Server

[NOTE]
The Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition doesn't support the dashboard feature.

=== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of a server on-premises:

. Select a server in the *Servers* page to open the side panel.
. Click the *View Details* button.
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left.

You can also drill down to this dashboard if you first open the dashboard for a cluster or server group that contains the server, then click on the hyperlink on the name of the server.

image::monitoring-dashboards-server.png[]

=== Navigate the Dashboard

The dashboard shows several metrics divided into two panes:

* *Overview*
* *Breakdown*

All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cbd92.png[]

By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

image::monitoring-dashboards-hover.png[]


If your server runs multiple applications, you can single out one or several and view the performance of these in a separate set of charts. To do so, select one or many, and a side-panel will display on the right with this data.

image::monitoring-dashboards-39935.png[]



[TIP]
Set up xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc#conditions-on-mule-servers[alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.

=== Metrics in the Server Dashboard

The graphs in this dashboard cover different metrics related to memory and CPU usage. You can see these two at a high level on the *Overview* tab, or you can dig into the *Breakdown* to see a detailed series of metrics that tracks each part of the memory separately.


At a high level, memory can be thought of as divided into what’s in the JVM heap and what’s outside of it.

The heap is the area where all Java objects reside. The heap is created when the JVM is started up, it can be scaled up or down in size without interrupting the applications in it. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection, objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

The non-heap memory stores per-class structures such as a runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods and constructors.

The graphs in this dashboard that display memory usage levels, in both the *Overview* and the *Breakdown* tabs, track the following three values:

* *Used* - The amount of memory (in MB) that is currently in use.
* *Committed* - The amount of memory (in MB) guaranteed to be available for use by the Java VM. This amount may change over time. The amount of committed memory will always be greater than or equal to the amount of used memory.
* *Total* - The maximum amount of memory (in MB) that can be used. This amount may change or be undefined. A memory allocation may fail if the Java VM attempts to increase the used memory to be greater than committed memory, even if the amount used is below the total.


=== Heap Memory

This metric found in the *Overview* tab refers to the total heap memory usage in MB. See the <<Breakdown Tab,*Breakdown* tab>> for details about each of its components.

image::monitoring-dashboards-heap.png[]

* Heap Memory Usage
* Heap Commited Memory
* Total Memory

=== CPU

This metric found in the *Overview* tab refers to total CPU usage of the server, as a percentage.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cpu.png[]

* CPU Usage
* System Available Processing power.
* System Load Average.

+
[NOTE]
Not available in Windows.

=== Thread Count

This graph displays the number of individual threads over time.

image::monitoring-dashboards-threads.png[]

Threads here refer to threads of execution in Java. The JVM allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.


=== Garbage Collection


The JVM implements the garbage collection mark-and-sweep algorithm, which consists of two phases.
In the first phase, called the mark phase, finds and marks all accessible objects. In the second phase, the garbage collection algorithm scans through the heap and reclaims all the unmarked objects. This phase is called the sweep phase.

=== Class Loading

The class loading graph shows the amount of classes that are currently loaded or being loaded in total across all apps in the JVM.

image::monitoring-dashboards-classloading.png[]

=== Heap Memory Metrics

The following metrics relate to the portion of the server memory that makes up the JVM Heap.

==== Par Eden / Eden Space

The pool in the Heap Space from which memory is initially allocated for most objects.

image::monitoring-dashboards-eden.png[]

==== Par Survivor / Survivor Space

The pool in the Heap containing objects that have survived the garbage collection of the Eden space.

image::monitoring-dashboards-survivor.png[]

==== Tenured Generation

The pool in the Heap containing objects that have existed for some time in the survivor space.

image::monitoring-dashboards-tenure.png[]

=== Non-heap Memory Metrics

The following metrics refer to memory that exists outside the JVM Heap.

==== Code Cache

This non-heap space contains memory that is used for compilation and storage of native code.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cahce.png[]

==== Compressed Class Space

[NOTE]
Only Available when using JDK 8+.

image::monitoring-dashboards-class-space.png[]

==== Metaspace

JVM memory space that uses native memory for the representation of class metadata.
Only Available when using JDK 8+.

image::monitoring-dashboards-meta.png[]

== The Dashboard for a Cluster or Server Group

=== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of a cluster or a server group on-premises:

. Select a cluster or server group in the *Servers* page to open the side panel.
. Click the *View Details* button.
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left.

=== Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard shows three separate metrics:

* CPU usage, as a percentage of the capacity
* Memory usage, in MB
* Heap total, in MB

image::monitoring-dashboards-5cd3c.png[]

All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cbd92.png[]

The aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included will be charted as a single plot line on the main set of graphs.

You can break down this information into either individual servers or individual applications, note the two tabs that allow you to pick a perspective:

image::monitoring-dashboards-6fe9f.png[]

Then, select one or many servers or applications, and a side-panel will display on the right with this data.

From this menu, you can also click on an individual server name to be taken to the dashboard page for <<The Dashboard for a Server, that individual server>>.

[TIP]
Set up xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.
