This topic details the process to follow for deploying Mule applications via the Runtime Manager REST API. The Runtime Manager REST API enables you to programmatically access much of the functionality provided by the Runtime Manager.

The process described is to be implemented as a task in the Continuous Integration pipeline. The task could be implemented as either a shell (e.g. Microsoft PowerShell, Bash, etc.) script or a Jenkins/Maven Plugin written in Java.

For a more complete reference of all the operations that are supported through the API, see https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/ae639f94-da46-42bc-9d51-180ec25cf994/apis/38784/versions/127446/pages/182845[API Reference 1.5].


A Mule Maven Plugin also exists that provides exactly the same capabilities. Therefore this document is to be used as an alternative for those who cannot or do not want to use the plugin.

Also note that a xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub API] also exists that allows you to deploy applications to CloudHub. This document is intended for deploying to your own servers that are on-premises or to other cloud servers.

== Data Format

All resources or methods that return or accept a type use the JSON as the data format. As an example, here's data you might receive, in JSON format, in response to a request to get an application:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "access_token": {
    "access_token": "4c091a7c-5d28-43af-b949-214251e5472c",
    "expires_in": 3543
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "c4cf05d7-74c4-4178-b013-d976c57b4c8a",
    "organization": {
      "name": "MyOrganisation",
      "id": "8d05377b-132c-43ef-994b-4cd8143e6c79"
    }
  }
}

== Workflow Overview

The workflow explained below can be carried out by various different means depending on your preference, but the steps remain the same. It first logs your user into the Anypoint Platform, obtains information about the servers/server groups/clusters that are registered on that account, and then deploys an application to it. It interfaces with the APIs for the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform Access Management and Runtime Manager.

The workflow must receive the following input parameters:

* *Username* - The Anypoint Platform account username
* *Password* - Password for the Anypoint Platform username
* *Environment* - The deployment environment (Dev, Test, Prod, etc.)
* *Target Name* - The name of the target onto which deploy the application
* *Target Type* - The type of target (Server, Cluster or ServerGroup)
* *Artifact Name* - Name of the Mule application to deploy
* *File* - The binary file of the Mule application to deploy

The workflow executes the following API calls in sequence:

. Call *Login* on the Access Management API with valid Anypoint Platform Username and Password to obtain the 'access_token' and 'token_type' to use in all the subsequent calls.
. Call *Accounts* on the Access Management API to retrieve the organization 'id'.
+
[TIP]
This step is not mandatory, as the organization identifier can be passed as a local parameter to the task due to its static nature.

. Call *Environments* on the Access Management API, passing the organization 'id' retrieved in the previous step and choosing the correct environment 'id' based on the relevant environment name (e.g. Dev, Test, Production, etc.).
. Call either the *Servers*, *Clusters* or *Server Groups* on the *Runtime Manager API*, passing the server /cluster / server group name, as well as the retrieved organization 'id' and environment 'id'. This returns all of the data about this server /cluster / server group, including the 'targetId'.
. Call *Applications* on the *Runtime Manager API*, passing the organization's 'id' and the environment's 'id', to retrieve the application's 'id' and the rest of its data.
. Call *Applications* on the *Runtime Manager API*, passing the organization's 'id', the environment's 'id', 'artifactName', 'targetId' (retrieved in the in step 4), the Mule application .zip 'file' to deploy and optionally the application 'id'. See xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub] for details on how the deployment procedure is through the UI.

== Login (Access Management API)

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|API Endpoint |+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login+
|Method |POST
|Headers |
|Content-Type | application/json
|===


.Input
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "username": "donald.duck",
  "password": "aBs12Dvz5"
}

.Output
[source,json,linenums]

{
  "access_token": "895d1a05-ba24-44f2-a9df-3675c1bde97b",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "redirectUrl": "/accounts/#/cs/profile/home"
}
----

If using Jenkins, the *Username* and *Password* will need to be configured in the task. It is advised to create a dedicated Anypoint Platform account used exclusively for deployment and CI related activities.

The task will have to concatenate the 'token_type' and 'access_token' and save them for the duration of the entire workflow process. The fields must be concatenated as follows:

'token = token_type + " " + access_token'

*E.g.* '"bearer 895d1a05-ba24-44f2-a9df-3675c1bde97b"'

The token in its concatenated form must be passed as header in every subsequent API call.


== Accounts (Access Management API)


[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|API Endpoint |+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/me+
|Method |GET
|Headers | Authorization: token (from step 1)

    "access_token": "4c091a7c-5d28-43af-b949-214251e5472c",
    "expires_in": 3543
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "c4cf05d7-74c4-4178-b013-d976c57b4c8a",
    "organization": {
      "name": "MyOrganization",
      "id": "8d05377b-132c-43ef-994b-4cd8143e6c79"
    }
  }
}
----

This step is used to retrieve the organization identifier that is used later in the process. It is not mandatory, as the organization identifier is very unlikely to change, so you could have it hardcoded into your script.

The task must then extract the organization identifier from the location 'user.organisation.id' and save it for later use.


== Environments (Access Management API)


[%header,cols="30a,70a"]

      "isProduction": true
    }
  ],
  "total": 3
}
----

This step is to retrieve the 'id' for the environment that you wish to deploy to, it is later used as the target for the deployment in a further step. The organization 'id' retrieved in step 2 must be passed as part of the API URI.

This task needs to pick up the right environment 'id' based on the provided Environment, that you may set as an input at the beginning of the workflow. The environment 'id' must be extracted from the path 'data[i].id', where 'data[i].name == inputEnvironment' (it may take values like 'Dev', 'Test', 'Production' or any valid environment name that set up in your Anypoint Platform).


== Servers (Runtime Manager API)


=== GET Servers

[NOTE]
This step must be executed only if the *Target Type* passed as an input parameter to the workflow task is equal to *Server*.

This step retrieves the application 'id' to determine whether the following step is a new deployment (6a) or a re-deployment (6b).

The application 'id' must be extracted from 'data[i].id' where 'data[i].artifact.name == inputArtifactName' and 'data[i].target.id == serverId' / 'clusterId' / 'serverGroupId'

This step re-deploys the actual Mule application artifact to a target environment and server / cluster / server group.




== Status Codes and Error Handling

When you call the REST APIs, the following status codes are returned:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Status Code |Description
|200 |The operation was successful.
|201 |The resource (such as, application) was created. The Location header  contains the location of the resource.
|404 |The resource was not found.
|409 |When creating a resource (such as, server, server group, or deployment), a resource with that name already exists.
|500 |The operation was unsuccessful. See the HTTP body for details.
|===

When errors occur (for example, a 500 status code), the HTTP response contains a JSON response with an error message. For example:

[source,json,linenums]
----
500
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Date: Mon, 10 Aug 2015 00:12:55 GMT

{
