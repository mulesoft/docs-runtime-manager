All maintenance to the Runtime Manager console, platform services, and worker cloud (see xref:cloudhub-architecture.adoc[CloudHub Architecture]) is performed during the maintenance windows specified in the http://status.mulesoft.com[Status] page, except for critical security issues, which are fixed immediately.

MuleSoft policy is to perform all maintenance transparently and without any downtime to your integrations running in the worker cloud wherever possible. In cases where downtime for the console, platform services, or workers is unavoidable, MuleSoft communicates these maintenance windows at least eight hours in advance and typically seven days in advance, with the exception of critical security patches, which might be fixed immediately.
