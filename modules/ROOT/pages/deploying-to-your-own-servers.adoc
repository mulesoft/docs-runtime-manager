You can deploy a Mule application to a local server using:

* xref:deployment-strategies.adoc#cloudhub-deployments[Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager cloud console]
* xref:deployment-strategies.adoc#anypoint-platform-pce-deployments[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Runtime Manager console]
* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/arm-rest-services[Runtime Manager API]
* xref:mule-runtime::deploy-on-premises.adoc[Mule Maven plugin]

When you use Runtime Manager to manage a server, you cannot use other deployment and management methods or tools to manage it.

== Prerequisites

Before you can deploy to a local server, you must first:

. xref:mule-runtime::runtime-installation-task.adoc[Download and install Mule].
. xref:servers-create.adoc[Add a server to Runtime Manager].


To copy an application from a non-production (Sandbox) environment to a production environment, ensure that you have permission on both environments.

To avoid compatibility issues, also ensure that:

* The Mule versions on the servers in both environments are the same or compatible.
* The deployment target type (single server, server group, or cluster) in both environments is the same.


== Deploy an Application from Runtime Manager


To deploy an app to your local server from Runtime Manager:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform.
. Select *Runtime Manager*.
. In the *Applications* page, click *Deploy application*.
. Provide a name for your application.
+
The application name identifies your application in Runtime Manager and must be unique across environments.
Runtime Manager alerts you if the name is already in use.
+
Application names can contain between 3 and 42 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and dashes (-).
They cannot contain spaces or other characters.
+
//NO RENAME SHARED
include::partial$no-rename.adoc[tag=noRenameApp]

. Select the deployment target.
+
The target must be a running server, server group, or cluster.
+
To deploy to CloudHub, see xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploy to CloudHub].

. Specify the application file:

** Import a file from Exchange:

.. Click *Choose file* and then select *Import file from Exchange*.
.. Select *Application* for the type.
.. Enter the name of your application in the search box.
.. Select the application to deploy, select a version from the *Version* menu, and then click *Select*.

** Upload an application ZIP file:

.. Click *Choose file* and then select *Upload file*.
.. Select the file to upload and then click *Open*.

** Copy an application from a non-production environment:

.. Click *Get from sandbox*.
+
This button is available only if a non-production environment exists.

.. Select the environment, such as Sandbox, from which to get the application.
.. If necessary, search for the application to deploy.
.. Select the application and then click *Apply*.
+
Only applications that are deployed to a local server, server group, or cluster appear in the list.
Applications deployed to CloudHub can only be promoted to run on other CloudHub workers.

. Click tabs to configure application options:
+
.The arrow shows the configuration tabs on the *Deploy Application* page.
image::rtm-deploy-to-own-servers.png[Configuration tabs on the Deploy Application page]
+
*Deployment Target* tab::
The server, server group, or cluster that you selected determines the Mule version.
+
Ensure that this Mule version is the same version used to develop your application.

*Insight* tab::
Specify metadata options for the Insight analytics feature.
See xref:insight.adoc[Insight].
*Properties* tab::
Specify properties (key-value pairs) that the application uses during deployment and while running.
+
--
When you deploy an application from a non-production environment (*Get from sandbox*), the new application inherits any properties defined in the original application.
You can update these properties as required on the *Properties* tab before deploying the application.

See xref:hybrid-manage-props.adoc[Manage Properties for Applications On-Premises] and xref:secure-application-properties.adoc[Safely Hide Application Properties].
--
*Logging* tab::
Configure the logging level for the application: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `FATAL`.
+
--
Alternatively, you can configure logging by modifying the `level` value in the `log4j2.xml` file.
See xref:mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc#configuring-custom-logging-settings[Configuring Custom Logging Settings] and https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[Apache Logging Services].
--

+
--
After you deploy the application, two additional tabs are available:

*Flow Monitoring* tab::
Specify to make flow monitoring metadata available in the applications *Flows* page.
*Alerts History* tab::
View alerts for the application.
--

. Click *Deploy Application*.

The new application appears in the list of deployed applications in the Applications tab.

== Change a Deployed Application

You can change the application file of a deployed application:

. Select your application in the *Applications* page to open its corresponding panel.
. Click *Choose File* to upload a new file.

Your application might experience a moment of downtime while the new version is launched in the server, server group, or cluster.


== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to `Failed` and the status area indicates that an error occurred.
Check the log details for any application deployment errors.
Correct the error, upload the application, and redeploy the application.
