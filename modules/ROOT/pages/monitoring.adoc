After you have deployed your application, following any of the possible xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategies] supported by the Runtime Manager, you can use the Runtime Manager to monitor its performance and that of the server/s it runs on (in case you're deploying on-premises).

[NOTE]
Depending on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategy] you're using, there is currently a different set of possible monitoring resources available. This feature gap will be gradually reduced as new releases implement the missing features on either side.


== Monitoring Applications

You're able to access monitoring information through the following tools:

* xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts] – image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
image:logo-pcf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Pivotal Cloud Foundry"] Send e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.


* xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc[Dashboards] – image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
image:logo-pcf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Pivotal Cloud Foundry"] See the evolution of key performance metrics related to service usage and available processing power



* xref:notifications-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Notifications] – image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
image:logo-pcf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Pivotal Cloud Foundry"] Certain events can trigger notifications that are visible when clicking on the bell icon on the Anypoint Platform. You can also create Custom Notifications for any event that interests you.

== Monitoring Flows

You can view information about individual flows within an application through the following tools:

*  xref:flow-metrics.adoc[Flow Metrics] –
image:logo-cloud-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
image:logo-pcf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Pivotal Cloud Foundry"]
View the evolution of metrics for each flow in an application.


== Monitoring Servers

On applications that are deployed on-premises, you'll be able to obtain information about the servers through the following tools:

* xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts] – image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"]
Send e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.


* xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc#the-dashboard-for-a-server[Monitoring Dashboards] – image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition"] See the evolution of key performance metrics related to service usage and available processing power
