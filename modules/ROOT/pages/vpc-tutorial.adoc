This tutorial walks you through the creation of a *virtual private cloud* configuring firewall rules. +
To be able to create a VPC, your organization needs to purchase a VPC offering and your account needs to meet the necessary permissions to create and administrate a VPC.

To create a VPC, log in to your Anypoint Platform and follow these steps:

. Select the `VPCs` tab from the navigation bar to your left.
. Click the Create VPC option:
+

+
You can start passing the parameters to define and configure your VPC:
+
image::vpc-and-load-balancer-creation-35c7d.png[]
+
. A VPC name. +
For this tutorial, name your VPC `vpc-tutorial`.
. The region to which the VPC is bound. +
In this case, the VPC is bound to `US East (Virginia)`.
+
[NOTE]
--
All VPCs must be associated to a CloudHub region.
--
+
. The size of your VPC in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (*CIDR*) notation. +
Set it to 10.111.0.0/24 which grants us 256 IP addresses from 10.111.0.0 to 10.111.0.255. +
The CIDR Blocks chosen for the VPC should ideally come from a private IP space, and should not overlap with any other VPC's CIDR Blocks or any CIDR Blocks in use in your corporate network.
+
[CAUTION]
--
Once the VPC is created, it is not possible to resize it, nor to edit your selected CIDR block. +
Understanding how to size your VPC is crucial at this point. If you are not sure how to configure this, make sure to follow our xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc#size-your-vpc[VPC sizing] guide.
--
+
. Set an environment to which your VPC is bound. +
For this example, the environment is left blank so every application deployed to US-EAST gets associated to this VPC disregarding to which environment it is being deployed.
. Set whether this VPC is the default for the region in which it is being created. +
This example sets the VPC as the default. This means that all environments in this region that are not associated to a VPC will be, by default, associated to `vpc-tutorial`.
. Set the business group to which your VPC is bound. +
By leaving it blank, the VPC is associated to the main organization.
+

+
. Click the *Firewall Rules* option.
.. All inbound traffic is blocked by default. Firewall rules are required to allow traffic to your worker. +
The UI suggests you a list of most used firewall rules. For this example, add a firewall rule with type 'http.private.port' from `Anywhere`. +
Note that the port range is automatically set to `8091`.
+
This means that only connections through the port `8091` are whitelisted inside the VPC and that your worker will listen to all interfaces coming through port `8091`. +
Setting this firewall rule allows a xref:cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer.adoc[dedicated load balancer] to communicate to your workers using its default configurations.
+
Additionally, to properly receive requests from the load balancer, all applications that are deployed to the VPC must be listening on port `8091`.
. Click *Create VPC*.

[TIP]
--
Optionally you can click the *Internal DNS* option.

This option allows you to xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc#set-up-internal-dns[set up internal DNS servers] to resolve your private host names.

.. Click the `Add New IP` button and type your public DNS IP address. +
Click the `Add to List` or hit `enter`. +
You can pass up to 3 IP addresses.
+
image::vpc-tutorial-f7641.png[]
+
.. Click the `Add New Domain` button and type the private domains that need to be resolved using your DNS servers. +
Click the `Add to List` or hit `enter. +
It is possible to add several private domains.
+
image::vpc-tutorial-7770c.png[]
+
Whenever those private domains are provided, your worker resolves them using your private DNS, so you can still use the internal host names of your private network.
--

From this moment on, any application that is deployed to US-EAST (disregarding the environment used), will be deployed to this VPC. +

== Connect to your VPC

xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc#vpc-connectivity-methods[VPC connectivity methods] (IPSEC, AWS Peering, etc) are not a self-serve function at this time. +
To configure a connection between your Cloudhub VPC and your infrastructure, download link:{attachmentsdir}/VPC-form-v9.3-template.xlsx[the VPC discovery form] (requires at least MS Excel 2007 with macros enabled), enter data to communicate the necessary details required for your connectivity method and send it to MuleSoft customer support.

The SLA for configuring VPC is 5 business days after the VPC discovery form has been completed and returned, though it may be completed sooner.

== Update an Existing VPC

image::vpc-tutorial-c5a66.png[]

. Find your VPC from the list of existing VPC in the UI, and select it.
. You can update:
.. Environments +
You can select one or more specific environment from the drop down menu.
+
image::vpc-tutorial-6dea0.png[]
+
.. Business Groups +
You can select one or more business group from the drop down menu.
+
image::vpc-tutorial-981cc.png[]
+
.. Firewall Rules +
You edit existing firewall rules, or add new ones.
+
image::vpc-tutorial-fa890.png[]
+
.. Internal DNS +
This option allows you to set a list of internal host names to be resolved using your DNS servers for which you need to provide their public IP addresses.
+
image::vpc-tutorial-0b7b2.png[]
+
Set your public DNS IP address and hit `enter` or click the blue check mark. +
+
image::vpc-tutorial-df177.png[]
+
Add the private domains that need to be resolved using your DNS server and hit `enter` or click the blue check mark.
+
. When you finished all your editing, click *Apply Changes*.
