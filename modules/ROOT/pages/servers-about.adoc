This topic provides a general description of servers in Runtime Manager.

Runtime Manager provides a single management interface where you can manage applications running in the cloud, on local servers, on server groups that are on-premises within your data center, or on clusters of servers. Applications that are on-premises run on Mule runtime instances on a single server or on a group of servers.

Servers enable Runtime Manager to communicate with runtime manager agent. After creating a server, you can use Runtime Manager to deploy applications to remote runtimes. Servers also enable you to view information about the local environment where a Mule runtime is installed.

You must create a server for each Mule runtime you want to manage. To manage environments with multiple Mule runtimes, you can create server groups and clusters.
