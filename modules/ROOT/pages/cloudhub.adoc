http://www.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/ipaas-cloud-based-integration-demand[CloudHub] is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) where you can deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications in the cloud, create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premises applications with cloud services, and much more.

== Create an Application for CloudHub

image::logo-app.png[app]

* See xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub].
* See xref:building-an-https-service.adoc[Building an HTTPS Service on CloudHub] to include HTTPS support in this application.

[TIP]
For examples of more applications, see xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange].

You can deploy the same Mule applications to CloudHub or to an xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[on-premises server]. There are some differences in how features work between the environments, which you need to consider when you plan your deployment strategy. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Options].


== Deploy your Application to CloudHub

image::logo-deploy.png[deploy]

Learn how you can deploy your applications to CloudHub:

* xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub]
* xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc[Anypoint Platform Command Line Interface (CLI)]

=== Easy Scalability

CloudHub is an elastic cloud, meaning it scales on demand. You can start small and scale up as your needs grow, without changing your applications or experiencing downtime. CloudHub provides a scalable architecture â€“ one on which you can build integration applications, publish REST APIs, or Web services, and much more.


=== Integration with Anypoint Studio

With xref:studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio (Studio)] you can quickly build integration applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks, without leaving Studio. See xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc#from-anypoint-platform[Deploying to CloudHub] for more information.

Once your application is deployed to CloudHub's multi-tenant runtime, access it like any other application deployed through the platform, by http://anypoint.mulesoft.com[signing into] Anypoint Platform, and then going to Runtime Manager.

=== Integrate Cloud and Enterprise Applications

The CloudHub xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC)] enables you to construct a secure pipe to on-premises applications through an IPsec VPN tunnel, Anypoint VPC peering, or direct connection.

=== CloudHub API

To automate tasks or automatically deploy to CloudHub, use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/cloudhub-api[CloudHub REST API]. This enables you to perform tasks such as manage and monitor your applications and scale your applications.

== Manage your Application

image::logo-manage.png[manage]

Learn how you can manage an application that is currently running in CloudHub:

* xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc[Manage Deployed Applications] has information about settings that are general to all applications&#8212;both those deployed to CloudHub and to on-premises servers.
* xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[Manage Applications on CloudHub] has information about settings that are specific to applications on CloudHub.

=== Manage Applications in Runtime Manager

Maintain your applications on CloudHub through the xref:index.adoc[Runtime Manager], an intuitive cloud console where you can xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc[manage] and xref:monitoring.adoc[monitor] every aspect of your applications in a centralized location.

[NOTE]
You can view the live status and detailed service history for the Runtime Manager console, platform services, and the CloudHub worker cloud on https://status.mulesoft.com/[`status.mulesoft.com`] for the US platform.
For the EU platform visit https://eu1-status.mulesoft.com/[`eu1-status.mulesoft.com`]


== Monitor your Applications

image::logo-monitor.png[monitor]

Through various tools, Runtime Manager allows you to triage problems, view logs, set up alerts, view dashboards, and more. See xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications] for an overview on the different ways that the Runtime Manager enables you to monitor your running applications.


== Limitations

Cloudhub blocks outbound SMTP traffic when more than 20 emails are sent in one hour.
