If there are APIs associated to the gateway you want to delete, Runtime Manager displays a message prompting you to either:

* Move the associated APIs to another gateway.
* Delete all associated APIs.

Once you have moved or deleted all the associated APIs, follow the steps previously described to delete a gateway and confirm the deletion.

Deleted gateways are shown with status **Deleted** for 30 days before it is removed from the gateways list.

Deleting a gateway from the Runtime Manager UI simply removes the connection between Anypoint Platform and the gateway and all its replicas.
This action does not remove the gateway from the server. To manually delete a gateway from your server, see xref:gateway::flex-conn-manage.adoc[Managing Flex Gateway in Connected Mode]
//Ask Chris about gateways unregistration.

[NOTE]
If you delete a gateway, you lose all its configuration history and will not be able to recover it.
