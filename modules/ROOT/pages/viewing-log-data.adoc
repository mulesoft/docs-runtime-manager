CloudHub provides access to log data that includes deployment messages and events for each worker.


[NOTE]
====
Logs and diagnostics are currently available only for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. In cases where applications are deployed using the Runtime Manager local server, you can send data xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[to External Analytics Software]. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategies] and xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

Applications deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) don't expose any log data through Runtime Manager, but you can see event logs on Pivotal's UI.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before it is purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. Open a support case at: https://support.mulesoft.com[https://support.mulesoft.com] for more information.

== View Logs

. In Runtime Manager, click *Applications* in the left menu, then click the application that is deployed to CloudHub to open its management options.
. In the left menu, click *Logs*. The application logs are displayed.

//image::elmstart.png[ELMStart]

. The *Deployments* section on the right of the logging screen lets you selectively view the output by day, Deployment, System Log, and Workers. You can unapply a filter by unticking the checkbox next to a date.

. You can search for log content, or click *Advanced* to search for a specified time, day, date range, or by message priority. After you specify the search criteria, click *Apply*. For more information, see <<Advanced Search, Advanced Search>>.

== Download Logs

Each worker in each deployment has separate logs you can download.

In the *Deployment* filters section on the right, find the date and worker you want to view, click the download icon next to it, and select *Logs*.

image::downloadlogs.png[DownloadLogs]

The log file is a text file with `.log` file extension and named in the format of `<deployment-ID>-<instance-ID>.log`. You can view this file with a text editor.


== Download Diagnostics

Diagnostics display the Java thread dump of each CloudHub worker in each deployment. These indicate the current state of the server, which is useful for debugging and support.

[NOTE]
For apps that run on a Mule version earlier than 3.8.0 (excluding version 3.7.4), diagnostics are not available.


In the *Deployment* filters section on the right, find the date and worker you want to view, click the download icon next to it, and select *Diagnostics*.

The downloaded log file is a text file with the `.txt` file extension and named in the format of `<app-name>-instance-<instance-ID>-<worker-number>-diag.txt`. You can view this file with a text editor.


[TIP]
====
On the diagnostics, the instance ID of a worker is the deployment id + worker number (0 to 4).

You can also download a diagnostics file directly, without having to go through the UI, by accessing the following URL:

`api/v2/applications/appName/instances/instanceId/diagnostics`
====


== About Log Persistence

CloudHub stores logs of up to 100 MB per application per worker, or for up to 30 days, whichever limit is reached first.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives log data for a limited period of time before it is purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. https://support.mulesoft.com[Contact Support] for more information.
====

== About Log Timezones

CloudHub stores log data in Universal Time (UTC); however, the console displays the log using your computer's local time zone.


== Search Logs


Advanced search lets you search logs by date and priority.

To access advanced search, click *Advanced* in the search field.

=== Search by Date and Time

The *Date & Time* filter lets you search the log by specifying a date range. Possible values are:

* Last hour
* Last 24hrs
* Last week
* Last month

=== Search by Message Priority

The *Priority* filter lets you view specific events in the log. You can also specify different priorities by typing `priority<type>` in the search box, as shown in the Command column in the table.

Possible values are:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
| Value
| Description
| Command

| All Priorities
| List all messages
| N/A

| ERROR
| List only error messages, such when an exception occurs.
| priority:ERROR

| FATAL
| List only fatal messages for when an application fails
| priority:FATAL

| INFO
| List informative messages
| priority:INFO

| SYSTEM
| List messages about application and worker startup
| priority:SYSTEM

| CONSOLE
| List message about console events such as setting the objectstore
| priority:CONSOLE

| WARN
| List warning messages
| priority:WARN

| DEBUG
| List debugging messages
| priority:DEBUG

|===

=== Wildcard Searching

You can filter log data by entering search terms into the search box at the top of the log page that match results in the log message. You can also search for an exact term in the log message with a few common quantifiers for wildcard searching:

* `?` - The question mark matches zero or one of the preceding elements.
* `*` - The asterisk matches zero or more of the preceding element.
