CloudHub provides access to log data that includes deployment messages and events for each worker.

Logs and diagnostics are currently available only for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. In cases when applications are deployed to a local server, you can send data to external analytics software.


For more advanced searching and log management, you can:

* Use Anypoint Monitoring.
+
See xref:monitoring::index.adoc[Anypoint Monitoring Overview].
* Integrate your CloudHub app with your logging system using the Log4j configuration.
+
See xref:custom-log-appender.adoc[Integrate with Your Logging System Using Log4j].


== View Logs

View logs for applications deployed to CloudHub.

. In Runtime Manager, click *Applications* in the left menu, and then click the application that is deployed to CloudHub to open the management panel on the right.
. Click *Logs*.
+
The application logs are displayed.
. The *Deployments* section on the right of the logging screen lets you selectively view the output by day, deployment, system log, and workers. You can remove a filter by unselecting the checkbox next to a date:
+
.The arrow shows the checkbox to filter log output by deployment on the *Logs* page.

== Download Logs

Each worker in each CloudHub deployment has separate logs you can download.

. In the *Deployment* filters section on the right, find the date and worker you want to view.
. Click the download icon next to the worker, and select *Logs*:
+
.The arrow shows the icon to download log output by deployment on the *Logs* page.
image::cloudhub-logs-download.png[Download log output by worker on the Logs page]

The log file is a text file with the file extension `.log` in the format `<deployment-ID>-<instance-ID>.log`. You can view the log file with a text editor.

To archive or download CloudHub application logs for audit, analytics, or other purposes at regular intervals, use the custom log appender to extract logs.
See xref:custom-log-appender.adoc[Integrate with Your Logging System Using Log4j].


== Download Diagnostics

Diagnostics display the Java thread dump of each CloudHub worker in each deployment. These indicate the current state of the server, which is useful for debugging and support.

For apps running on Mule versions earlier than 3.8.0 (excluding version 3.7.4), diagnostics are not available.


To download diagnostics:

. In the *Deployment* filters section on the right, select the date and worker for which you want to download diagnostics.
. Click the download icon next to the worker, and select *Diagnostics*:
+
.The arrow shows the icon to download diagnostics by worker on the *Logs* page.
image::cloudhub-logs-download-diag.png[Download diagnostics by worker on the Logs page]

The downloaded log file is a text file with the `.txt` file extension and named in the format of `<app-name>-instance-<instance-ID>-<worker-number>-diag.txt`. You can view this file with a text editor.


[TIP]
====
In diagnostics, the instance ID of a worker is the deployment ID plus the worker number (0 to 4).

You can also use the following URL to download a diagnostics file directly:

`api/v2/applications/appName/instances/instanceId/diagnostics`
====

== Deployment History Persistence

CloudHub stores up to 30 days of inactive deployments history based on the last modified time of the deployment.

== Log Persistence

CloudHub stores up to 100 MB of log data per application per worker, or up to 30 days, whichever limit is reached first.

== Log Timezones

CloudHub stores log data in Universal Time (UTC); however, the console displays the log using your computer's local time zone.


== Search Logs

Search for logs that contain specified values or search for logs by date and priority.


To search logs:

. Enter a value in the search box, or click *Advanced* to search for logs for a specified time, day, date range, and message priority.
. Click *Apply*.
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) *Advanced* search and (*2*) *Priority* on the *Logs* page.

=== Search by Date and Time

The *Date & Time* filter lets you search the log by specifying a date range. Possible values are:

* *Last hour*
* *Last 24 hours*
* *Last week*
* *Last month*

=== Search by Message Priority

The *Priority* filter lets you view specific events in the log. You can also specify different priorities by typing `priority<type>` in the search box, as shown in the *Command* column in the table.

Possible values are:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
| Value
| Description
| Command

| All Priorities
| List all messages
| N/A

| `ERROR`
| List only error messages, such as when an exception occurs.
| priority:ERROR

| `FATAL`
| List only fatal messages for when an application fails
| priority:FATAL

| `INFO`
| List informative messages
| priority:INFO

| `SYSTEM`
| List messages about application and worker startup
| priority:SYSTEM

| `CONSOLE`
| List message about console events such as setting the object store
| priority:CONSOLE

| `WARN`
| List warning messages
| priority:WARN

| `DEBUG`
| List debugging messages
| priority:DEBUG

|===

=== Wildcard Searching

You can filter log data by entering search terms into the search box at the top of the log page that match results in the log message.

You can also search for an exact term in the log message with a few common quantifiers for wildcard searching:

* `?` matches zero or one of the preceding elements.
* `&#8727;` matches zero or more of the preceding elements.
