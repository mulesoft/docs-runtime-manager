== Overview

*Notifications* are standard messages that appear in the Runtime Manager console to provide status information about your applications. You can access them via the bell icon on the top-right corner of the console.  When you have new notifications, the bell turns red.


[TIP]
You can also set up email xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[alerts] that can be sent to any email address to warn whenever a certain event has occurred. Notifications are currently only produced by applications deployed to CloudHub, for applications deployed on-premises, you should use Alerts.


== Managing Notifications

Each notification has a priority level and a message associated with it. If the notification is associated with a specific application, the application name is also provided.

Click *Show All Notifications* to view all notifications  including those that have already been read.

== Standard Notifications


For applications deployed to CloudHub, certain events that may occur to one of your applications automatically produces a notification:


[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Event |Message
| Worker will restart | A worker `<ip>` has become unresponsive. Restarting the worker.
| Worker has restarted | Restart SUCCEEDED for worker `<ip>`.
| Worker restart failed | Restart FAILED for worker `<ip>`.
| Maximum Restarts attempted for a worker| We've reached the maximum amount of restart attempts.
| Worker needs restarting, but restarts are disabled | A worker `<ip>` has become unresponsive. Restarts are disabled.
|===



== Custom Notifications

On applications that are deployed to CloudHub, you can create custom notifications using the CloudHub connector that must exist in your application.

. Download the CloudHub connector from xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange].

. Place an instance of the CloudHub connector in one of your project's flows, to be triggered when something meaningful happens.
. Configure the connector. In the *Operation* field select *Create Notification* and then set the *Domain*, *Message* and *Priority* for it.

+
You should now be receiving notifications.

. Optionally, set up email alerts to inform you when one of these custom events occurs. To set up email alerts, see xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts on Runtime Manager]. You must create an alert of type *Custom Notification Alert* that matches your custom notification.

See the  tutorial.

== Notification Retention

Notifications are retained by Anypoint Platform within the bounds of the following limits, whatever happens first:

* for 30 days
* up to 1000 notifications per application
