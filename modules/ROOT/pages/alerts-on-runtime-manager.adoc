= Configure Alerts
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]


Set up alerts that send an email notification when certain events occur. These can be events for an application or server. Runtime Manager includes several *standard alert* types that trigger notifications for common events, for example when:

* An application exceeds a certain number of events processed within a certain time period.
* A deployment completes with success or failure.
* CloudHub encounters a problem with the worker on an application via the worker monitoring system.
* A server is disconnected or deleted.

CloudHub also enables you to create a custom alert for an application. Custom alerts are triggered by notifications that your application sends to Runtime Manager console using the CloudHub Connector. See xref:custom-application-alerts.adoc[Custom Application Alerts] for more information. Custom alerts are available only for applications deployed to CloudHub. You cannot configure an alert for an application deployed to a customer-hosted runtime.

== Access Alerts

You can view alerts in Runtime Manager in a few ways.

* In Runtime Manager, click the *Alerts* tab to display a full list of alerts on your account.
* In the menu on the left, click the *Applications* tab, click an application to open the xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc#applications-dashboard[application dashboard], then click the *View Associated Alerts* link.
* In the menu on the left, click the *Servers* tab, click a server to open the xref:managing-servers.adoc#servers-dashboard[servers dashboard], then click the *View Associated Alerts* link.

== Rate Limits on Alerts

Anypoint Platform enforces rate limits that determine how often an alert is triggered. These limits prevent excessive emails from being sent. The rate limit is determined by several factors, including:

* CloudHub: When using CloudHub-Connector to trigger notifications and alerts, there is a limit of five custom application alerts per IP address, per second. If an application uses multiple workers, this limit is multiplied by the number of workers assigned to the application, since the limitation is enforced per IP. +
Custom notifications that trigger emails are also subject to the rate limit on email notifications described below.
* Alert emails: Both standard and custom alerts have a rate limit where only one alert notification email is sent every 2.5 seconds. This limit is enforced by a combination of organization, environment, alert (name/ID), and resource (application, server, server group, or cluster).


== Create an Alert

If you access the alerts screen through any of the paths listed above and you don't have any alerts set up yet, you will see the following screen:

image::create-first-alert.png[first-alert]

. Click the plus sign next to *Create your first alert*
+
image::create-alert.png[]

. Fill in the required fields:

* *Name* - Unique and meaningful name for the alert
* *Severity Level* - (Critical, Warning or Info)
+
[NOTE]
Different severity levels currently have no effect on alerts, but will in the future when further features are released.

* *Source* - Determines if this alert is associated with applications or servers. This field may not appear if your Anypoint Platform account doesn't support xref:managing-servers.adoc[local servers].
* *Application Type* - Associate the alert with applications deployed to xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[CloudHub or local servers].
+
[NOTE]
You can't create a single alert that spans applications deployed to both CloudHub and local servers. You must create two separate alerts to reach both types.
+
* *Server Type* - For servers, determine if you're managing a single server, a server group, or a cluster. If your servers aren't available on your menu, see xref:managing-servers.adoc[Managing Servers].
* *Application(s)* or *Server(s)* - Select the application or server to which to apply the alert.
* *Condition* - The condition that triggers the alert. The options depend on whether your alert is linked to a server, an application running on CloudHub, or an application running locally. Certain conditions require additional data, which is explained in a <<Alert Conditions, section below>>.
* *Subject* - Subject of the email that will be sent. Your subject may include variable <<Alert Properties>>.
* *Message* - Enter the body text for the email. Your message may include variable <<Alert Properties>>.
* *Recipients* - List the recipients of this email. You can select users of the platform, or enter email addresses of people who aren't in the organization.

. Click *Create Alert*.

. If an event that meets an alert condition occurs, an email like the following is sent:
+
image::alertemailmsg.png[AlertEmailMsg]


See below for more information on the alert conditions available for each alert source.

== Alert Conditions

Depending on what your alert's source is, you can select different event types. Some event types are simple success or failure notifications such as 'Application Deployment Success' and more complex notifications which require you to define parameters that appear as new fields in the form.

=== Conditions on CloudHub Deployed Applications

For applications deployed to CloudHub, you can choose any of the following alert conditions:

* *CPU Usage* - CPU usage of the CloudHub worker(s) that run the application.
+
image::cpu-usage.png[cpu]
+
To enable this condition, you must specify the duration and capacity threshold that triggers the alert.

* *Memory Usage* - Percentage of total memory allocated to the CloudHub worker(s) that run the application (includes the memory consumed by the JVM itself).
+
image::memory-usage.png[memo]
+
To enable this condition, you must specify the duration and capacity threshold that triggers the alert.

* *Custom Notification alert* – Looks at custom notifications and alerts when one contains specified text.
+
image::custom-alert.png[custom]
+
To enable this condition, you must specify the notifications that are the output of a CloudHub connector. This connector must exist in your Mule application. An alert is raised when the text in one of the notifications matches or contains the string that you provide in the *Contains* field. See xref:custom-application-alerts.adoc[Custom Application Alerts] for more information.
+
On *Custom Notification Alerts*, you can access a set of alert properties that you can compile into the notification message to provide more context.


* *Exceeds event traffic threshold*
+
image::alert-traffic.png[traffic]
+
To enable this condition, you must specify the duration and capacity threshold that triggers the alert. This threshold applies to all events of any type.
If during a certain period you get more than N events, you get an alert.
The meaning of this depends on the events you are tracking on your application.
For more information on event tracking, see xref:mule-runtime::business-events.adoc[Business Events].


* *Secure data gateway disconnected*
* *Secure data gateway connected*
* *Worker not responding*
* *Deployment success*
* *Deployment failure*

=== Conditions on Locally Deployed Applications

On an application that's deployed to local servers, both via the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc#deployment-scenarios[cloud console or the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition], you can select any of these alert conditions:

* *Number of errors*

+
image::alerts-on-runtime-manager-387e2.png[]

+
You must provide the number of errors that triggers the alert.
The time unit is per minute. An alarm is triggered when the error count goes over the threshold number in the timeslot of one minute.
+
[NOTE]
This alert is currently not available on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc#deployment-scenarios[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition].

* *Number of Mule messages*

+
image::alerts-on-runtime-manager-51033.png[]

+
You must provide the number of Mule messages, since the application was started, that trigger the alert.

+
[NOTE]
This alert is currently not available on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc#deployment-scenarios[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition].

* *Response time*
+
image::alerts-on-runtime-manager-45785.png[]

+
You must provide the maximum accepted response time--anything over this value triggers the alert.

+
[NOTE]
This alert is currently not available on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc#deployment-scenarios[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition].

* *Application Deployment success*
* *Application Deployment failure*
* *Application undeployed*


=== Conditions on Mule Servers


The available alert events vary depending on the *Server Type* field. The alerts detailed below are available on all target types (servers, server groups, and clusters):


* *CPU Usage* - CPU usage of the servers.
+
image::cpu-usage.png[cpu]
+
To enable this condition, specify values in the duration and capacity threshold parameters that, when crossed, trigger the alert.



* *Memory Usage* - Total memory usage in MB on the server.
+
image::memory-usage.png[memo]
+
To enable this condition, specify values in the duration and capacity threshold parameters that, when crossed, trigger the alert.

* *Server Load Average* - Average processing for a given time period.

+
image::alerts-on-runtime-manager-load-average.png[]

+
[NOTE]
Windows environments don’t provide this information, so this metric isn't available on Windows environments.

* *Server Thread Count* - Number of threads on the JVM.

+
