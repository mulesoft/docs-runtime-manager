You can set up alerts to send email notifications when application or server events occur.

Runtime Manager includes several standard alert types that trigger notifications for common events such as:

* An application exceeds a specific number of events processed within a specified period of time.
* A deployment is complete, either successfully or not.
* The worker monitoring system notifies CloudHub about a problem with a worker on an application.
* A server is disconnected or deleted.

You can also create custom alerts for applications deployed to CloudHub.
Custom alerts are triggered when your application sends notifications to the Runtime Manager console
using Anypoint Connector for CloudHub (CloudHub Connector).
See xref:custom-application-alerts.adoc[Custom Application Alerts] for information.

Runtime Manager retains 30 days of alert history.


== Rate Limits on Alerts

Anypoint Platform enforces rate limits that determine how often an alert is triggered and prevent excessive emails from being sent.
The following factors determine the rate limit:

* CloudHub custom application alerts
+
When using CloudHub Connector to trigger notifications and alerts,
the rate limit is five custom application alerts per IP address, per second.
This limit is enforced by IP address.
If an application uses multiple workers, this limit is multiplied by the number of workers
assigned to the application.
+
Custom notifications that trigger emails are also subject to the rate limit on email notifications.
* Alert emails (CloudHub and on-premises)
+
For both standard and custom alerts, the rate limit is one alert notification email sent every 2.5 seconds per organization.
This limit is enforced by a combination of organization, environment, alert (name or ID), and resource
(application, server, server group, or cluster).

== Create an Alert

To create an alert:

. In Runtime Manager, click *Alerts* in the left navigation pane.
+
** If no alerts are set up, you see:
+
.The arrow shows the *Create your first alert* option.
image::alerts-no-alerts.png[Alerts page with no alerts set up]
** If your account already has associated alerts, you see:
+
.The arrow shows the blue plus (*+*) icon on the *Alerts* page.
image::alerts-create-additional-alert.png[Alerts page with blue plus (+) icon]

. Click the blue plus (*+*) icon to create an alert.
+
image::alerts-create-alert.png[Create an Alert page]

. Complete the required fields:

* *Name*
+
Unique and meaningful name for the alert
+
The *Name* is limited to 256 characters.
* *Severity level*
+
Severity of the alert: *Critical*, *Warning*, or *Info*
+
* *Source*
+
The source of the alert: applications or servers
+
This field appears only if your Anypoint Platform account supports local servers.
* *Application type*
+
When the source is *Applications*, applications deployed to either CloudHub or local servers. Runtime Fabric application alerts are supported only using Anypoint Monitoring.
+
You can't create an alert that applies to both applications deployed to CloudHub and local servers.
You must create separate alerts for each deployment type.
+
* *Server type*
+
When the source is *Servers*, the type of server: single server, server group, or cluster.
+
If your servers aren't available on your menu, see xref:managing-servers.adoc[Servers, Server Groups, and Clusters].
* *Applications* or *Servers*
+
The application or server to apply the alert to
* *Condition*
+
The condition that triggers the alert
+
The available options depend on whether your alert is linked to a server,
an application running on CloudHub, or an application running locally.
Some conditions require additional data.
See <<Alert Conditions>>.
* *Subject*
+
The subject of the alert email to send when the alert is triggered
+
The subject can include variables.
See <<Alert Variables>>.
* *Message*
+
The body text for the email to send when the alert is triggered.
The message body can include variables.
See <<Alert Variables>>.
* *Recipients*
+
The recipients of the alert email
+
You can select up to 20 platform user IDs and enter up to 20 email addresses.
. Click *Create Alert*.

When an event that meets an alert condition occurs, Runtime Manager sends an email similar to the following:

image::alerts-alert-email.png[Anypoint Platform Alert Notification email]


== Alert Conditions

You can select different conditions depending on the alert source.
Some conditions are simple success or failure notifications, such as `Deployment success`.
Some more complex conditions require that you define parameters that appear as new fields in the form.
