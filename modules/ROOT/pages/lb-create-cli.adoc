You can create a dedicated load balancer (DLB) using the Anypoint Platform CLI.


== Prerequisites

Before you create a load balancer:

* Ensure that you are an administrator in the organization where you are creating the DLB.
* Create an Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) instance in the organization where you want to create a DLB.
* Create at least one certificate and private key for your certificate.

== Create a Load Balancer

Use this command to create a DLB from the CLI:

----
cloudhub load-balancer create myVPC myLB_name example-com-crt.pem example-com-private.pem
----

This command specifies the Anypoint VPC instance in which to create the DLB and the certificate and private keys that the DLB uses.
