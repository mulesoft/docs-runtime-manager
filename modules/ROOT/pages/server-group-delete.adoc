When deleting a server group, consider the following:

* Alert definitions and history for the server group are deleted.
* Servers assigned to the server group are not deleted. Servers that belong to the deleted group are displayed in the main server list. They can be used individually or be paired up into other server groups or clusters.
* Servers assigned to the group are not restarted or shutdown.
* Applications deployed to the servers in the server group are cloned on each server.
