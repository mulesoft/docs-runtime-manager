You can use Runtime Manager to create a dedicated load balancer (DLB) in your CloudHub environment.

== Prerequisites

Before creating a load balancer, perform the following:

* Ensure that your profile is authorized to perform this action by adding the *CloudHub Network Administrator* permission to the profile of the organization where you are creating the load balancer.
+
Similarly, the administrator role of the same organization also provides the authorization required.
* Create an Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) in the organization where you want to create a load balancer.
* Create at least one certificate and private key for your certificate.

== Create a Load Balancer

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*.

. Click load balancers, then click *Create Load Balancer*.

. Enter a name for your load balancer.
+
The CloudHub DLB name must be unique across all DLBs defined in Anypoint Platform (by all MuleSoft customers).
For this reason, you might want to append your organization name to your DLB name.
+
Each dedicated load balancer exposes an external domain `_lb-name_.lb.anypointdns.net` name where `_lb-name_` is the name you provide.

. Select a target Anypoint VPC from the drop-down list.

. Specify the amount of time the DLB waits for a response from the Mule application in the *Timeout in Seconds* field.
+
The default value is 300 seconds.

. Add any whitelisted classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) as required.
+
The IP addresses you specify here are the only IP addresses that can access the load balancer. The default value is `0.0.0.0/0`.

. Select the inbound HTTP mode for the load balancer.
+
This property specifies the behavior of the load balancer when receiving an HTTP request. Valid values are:
+
* *Off*
+
Causes the load balancer to silently drop the request.
* *On*
+
Accepts the inbound request on the default SSL endpoint using the HTTP protocol.
* *Redirect*
+
Redirects the request to the same URL using the HTTPS protocol.
. Specify options:
+
* *Disable Static IPs* specifies to use dynamic IPs, which do not persist when the DLB restarts.
* *Keep URL encoding* specifies to pass the entire request URI to the CloudHub worker as is (unchanged).
* *Support TLS 1.0* specifies TLS 1.0 support between client and DLB.
* *Upstream TLS 1.2* specifies to force TLS 1.2 between DLB and upstream CloudHub worker.
+
+
If you deselect this option, the DLB decodes the encoded part of the request URI before passing it to the CloudHub worker.

. Add a certificate.

.. Click *Add certificate*.
+
.The arrow shows the *Add certificate* option in the *Create Load Balancer* page.

.. On the *Create Load Balancer | Add certificate* page, select *Choose File* to upload both public key and private key files.
.. If you want to add a client certificate, click *Choose File* to upload the file.
+
The client certificate is a trusted CA certificate used to verify client certificates.

.. If you want to add URL mapping rules, click the *>* icon to display the options:
+
.The arrow shows the expand icon in the *Create Load Balancer | Add certificate* page.

+
If you add more than one URL mapping rule, order the rules in the list according to the priority in which they should be applied.
+
Click *Add New Rule*, and then specify the input path, target app, output path, and protocol.
.. Click *Save Certificate*.
. Click *Create Load Balancer*.
