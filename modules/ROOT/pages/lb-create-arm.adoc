You can use Runtime Manager to create a dedicated load balancer in your CloudHub environment.


== Prerequisites

To create a load balancer, ensure that you perform the following:

* Ensure that your profile is authorized to perform this action by adding the *CloudHub Network Administrator* permission to the profile of the organization where you are creating the load balancer. Similarly, the administrator role of the same organization also provides the authorization required.
* Create an Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) in the organization where you want to create a load balancer.
* Create at least one certificate and private key for your certificate.

== Creating a Load Balancer

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*.

. Click load balancers, then click *Create Load Balancer*.

. Provide a name, then select a target Anypoint VPC from the drop-down list.

. Add any whitelisted classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) as required.
+
The IP addresses you specify here are the only IP addresses that can access the load balancer. The default value is: 0.0.0.0/0.

. Select the inbound HTTP mode for the load balancer.
+
This property specifies the behavior of the load balancer when receiving an HTTP request. Valid values are:
+
* *Off*: causes the Load Balancer to silently drop the request.
* *On*: accepts the inbound request on the default SSL endpoint using the HTTP protocol.
* *Redirect*: redirects the request to the same URL using the HTTPS protocol.

. Add a certificate.

.. Click *Add Certificate*
.. Add both a public and private key.
.. (Optional) Select *Support TLS 1.0*.
.. (Optional) Add a client certificate.
+
The client certificate is trusted CA certificate used to verify client certificates.

.. (Optional) Add URL mapping rules.
+
If you add more than one URL mapping rule, order the rules in the list according to the priority in which they should be applied.

... Click *Add New Rule*.
... Specify the input path, target app, output path, and protocol.

.. Click *Save Certificate*.

. Click *Save Load Balancer*.
