The Anypoint Platform CLI provides three default options:

* The `--help` option displays usage information of the command.
* The `-o` or `--output` option lets you specify the command's output to the defined format. +
Supported values are `table`, `text`, and `json`. Defaults to `text` for non-interactive mode and `table` for interactive sessions.
