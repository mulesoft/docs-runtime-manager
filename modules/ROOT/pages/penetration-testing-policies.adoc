If your company security policies require that you perform vulnerability and penetration testing
against Anypoint Platform, request a Security Assessment before proceeding.


== Request a Security Assessment

To request a Security Assessment:

. Contact your MuleSoft Customer Success Manager to request the Security Assessment Request form and Security Assessment Agreement.
. Complete the request form and accept the agreement.
+
For information required to complete the request form, see the knowledge article https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000322336&type=1&mode=1[Complete the Security Assessment submission form].
. Send your completed Security Assessment Request form to mailto:securityassessment@salesforce.com[securityassessment@salesforce.com].
+
The automated system contacts you when your Security Assessment request is approved.
+
Check your Spam folder for the automated reply before contacting Salesforce.

== Run Penetration and Vulnerability Tests

Because penetration testing could interfere with other tenants, MuleSoft allows penetration testing
on your workers but not on other Anypoint Platform services.

[IMPORTANT]
Salesforce does not address any vulnerabilities found with custom development.
You must validate and fix any findings with your custom development.

=== Prerequisites

Before initiating penetration testing:

* Enable static IPs for the app.
+
By default, CloudHub workers do not use static IP addresses, so you can't test them because their IP addresses might change.
For information about how to enable static IPs, see xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc#static-ips-tab-settings[Static IPs Tab Settings].
* Assign a security resource at your company to review and validate findings from the tests.

=== Steps

After your Security Assessment request is approved, follow these steps:

. Run the penetration tests.
+
The Security Assessment Agreement includes restrictions and requirements for testing.
. Have your security resource use the following documents to identify common false positives or security issues related to settings:
+

** https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=Salesforce-Platform-Security-FAQs&type=1&language=en_US[Platform Security FAQ]
** https://help.salesforce.com[Salesforce Help]
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
You must complete this step before following up with Salesforce.

. Send any outstanding security vulnerability findings to mailto:security@salesforce.com[security@salesforce.com].
+
--
Include the following information in your email:

** Confirmation number for your Security Assessment approved by Salesforce
** Summary of all findings and associated severity level of each finding
** Detailed assessment report noting each finding
** Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
** All applicable HTTP requests and responses
** Explanation of why the example is considered a finding

For more information about how to submit a security vulnerability finding, see the
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000320207&type=1&mode=1[Security Vulnerability Finding Submittal Guide].
