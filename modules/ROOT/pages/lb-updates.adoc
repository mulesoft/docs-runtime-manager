The CloudHub dedicated load-balancer service provides quarterly updates that include the latest OS and security patches. If necessary, additional patches provide updates more often.
These updates don't include feature changes. 

Because these updates contain required security patches, you cannot roll back these updates once applied.

When updates are available, an *Update* button appears on the load balancers page:

The *Update* button also appears on the details page for the individual load balancer:

== Update a Load Balancer Manually

The *Update* button indicates a load balancer requires an update. You can schedule the update to occur at your convenience.

To update a load balancer:

. Click the *Update* button.
. At the *Update Load Balancer* prompt, click *Update*.
. Click the *release notes* link for details on the update. 

The update results in a rolling restart with no downtime. However, some inflight requests might be impacted. 

If you experience a sustained outage after updating, contact MuleSoft Support.
