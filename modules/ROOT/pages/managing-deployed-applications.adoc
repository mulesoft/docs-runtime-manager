After you deploy an application through Runtime Manager, you can use the console to monitor and manage it while running. Depending on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategy] used (where the application is deployed to and from what console), there is a different set of possible actions you can perform.

[TIP]
Whether you're using the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[cloud based] or the Private Cloud Edition of the Anypoint Platform, the features described in this page work identically in both. If you’re interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, please contact your sales representative.

This page introduces the basic management tools in the console that are common to both types of deployments:

* <<Start, Restart, Stop, and Delete an Application>>
* <<Status States>>
* <<Updating Your Application>>
* Various xref:monitoring.adoc[monitoring] and xref:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting] functionalities


On applications deployed to xref:managing-applications-on-your-own-servers.adoc[your own servers] you can also:

== Getting Started

Sign into Anypoint Platform and click *Runtime Manager*:

image::deploying-to-your-own-servers-get-to-arm.png[]

Runtime Manager has two main tabs--*Applications* and *Servers*.

=== Applications Tab

In Runtime Manager, an application is a Mule Application that is running on a Mule runtime or an API gateway runtime instance. The instance can be running in CloudHub, in an on-premise server of your organization, in a group of servers, or in a cluster.

In the *Applications* menu you can get a quick view of the applications that are currently deployed and running for your account. Click an entry to display additional information (as shown below), or click *Manage Application* to see the application's xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc[dashboard] and settings page:

image::amc-manageapplication.png[AMC_ManageApplication]

After you create at least one application, you can see your applications listed here.

[TIP]
For server groups, an application deployed to the group runs on every server in the group.

=== Servers Tab

[NOTE]
This tab is only relevant to deploying to servers on-premises. CloudHub workers aren't displayed here.

In Runtime Manager, a server is a Mule or API gateway instance in a location other than CloudHub (on-premises or in a different cloud server) that you must first register in the Runtime Manager console. Once registered and configured in this tab, you can deploy your applications to it through the *Applications* tab.

image::amc-servers2.png[AMC_Servers]

From the *Servers* tab, select one of the following options to perform these tasks:

* Add a Server (registers the server with the Runtime Manager console)
* Start Mule or API gateway
* Create a server group
* Create a cluster
* Add and remove servers from a server group
* Add and remove servers from a cluster
* Stop an application on a server
* Delete a server, server group or cluster


For more about the options on this tab, see xref:managing-servers.adoc[Managing Servers].

=== Switching Environments

After you have multiple environments in your organization, you can switch between them. From any screen in Runtime Manager, you can switch to a different environment by clicking the current environment, displayed in the upper left corner of the screen, and picking another environment.

image::managing-deployed-applications-0e10f.png[]

. Click the current environment in the top left corner.
. Select the environment to switch to.
. Click the *switch* button.

== Start, Restart, Stop, or Delete an Application

To start, restart, stop, or delete an application, click an application, and click the status down-arrow (the menus differ by Status):

image::amc-restartapp.png[AMC_StopStartDeleteApp]

Click *Start*, *Restart*, *Stop*, or *Delete* as needed.

* *Start* - Starts stopped applications
* *Restart* - Resets applications that have already started, and if the application is undeployed, sends the application's ZIP file to the server to start the application on the server
* *Stop* - Stops running applications
* *Delete* - Deletes the application

[IMPORTANT]
On CloudHub, after you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before it is purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. Open a support case at: https://support.mulesoft.com[https://support.mulesoft.com] for more information.

[NOTE]
====
For applications deployed through PCF:

* *Restart* - Redeploys your application on the virtual machine.
* *Stop* - Destroys the virtual machine running the application but retains the entry on Runtime Manager to keep log continuity.
* *Undeploy* - Destroys the virtual machine running the application and deletes the entry for it on Runtime Manager.

|===

== Applications Dashboard

If you select any of the applications on the *Applications* tab, a panel opens on the right. Here you can see additional information about the application and access its settings.

image::dashboard-ch.png[dashboard]

What this dashboard displays depends on if your application is deployed on xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] or on xref:managing-applications-on-your-own-servers.adoc[Mule]. You will always see the status, the time of the last modification, and the deployed application ZIP file. You can click the *Choose File* button to change the application ZIP file.

Applications on CloudHub display info about the CloudHub worker they run on.

Applications deployed on clusters and server groups display the list of servers and the status of each.

You can click the *Manage Application* button to access a menu where you can view and configure several more application settings:

image::managing-deployed-applications-38b94.png[]

From there you can also view the *Dashboad* to see the full detail dashboard of your application. See xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc[Monitoring Dashboards] for more info about what you can see here.

image::managing-deployed-applications-107ad.png[]


You can click the *Insight* button to see data at a transaction level. See xref:insight.adoc[Insight] for more information about what you can see here.

image::managing-deployed-applications-76124.png[]

[NOTE]
The dashboard and insights are features that are not currently available for the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategies].

== Monitoring Applications

Depending on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategy] used (where the applications are deployed to, and through what console). Different tools exist for monitoring events that occur on your application as well as the performance of the servers or virtual servers it runs on. See xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications] for more details.


== Updating Your Application

If you made changes to your applications and want to upload a new version:

. Click *Choose file* on the Deployment screen for that application. +
The new filename appears in italicized text.
. Click *Apply changes* to use the new file for deployment. +
Within a few seconds, your application redeploys. While redeploying, the application status indicator changes to blue, and then turns green after the deployment completes.
. For applications deployed to CloudHub, you can click *Logs* to see a live redeployment of your application.

[TIP]
If you're deploying your application to a cluster on-premises, Runtime Manager installs the new app version progressively on each server to keep the service working with no downtime throughout the process.

To update applications deployed to Runtime Fabric, see xref:runtime-fabric::app-versioning.adoc[Application Deployment Versioning]

== Alerts

You can set up email alerts that are sent whenever certain events occur to your application, such as deployment failures or application deletions. These alerts can be linked to a specific application or to all of them. See xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts] for instructions on how to do this.

All users of Anypoint Platform, even those without permissions to create alerts, can switch the alerts that are already created into an `active` or `inactive` state for their user. This determines what email alerts are sent to them.


[NOTE]
Switching an alert off from this view switches it off only for the current (signed in) user. Other users can still have active alerts.
