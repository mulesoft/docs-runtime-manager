A cluster is a set of up to eight servers that act as a single deployment target and high-availability processing unit. Unlike in server groups, application instances in a cluster are aware of each other, share common information, and synchronize statuses. If one server fails, another server takes over processing applications. A cluster can run multiple applications.

Before creating a cluster, you must create the Mule runtime engine instances and add the Mule servers to Anypoint Runtime Manager.


== Multicast vs Unicast Clusters


While configuring a cluster, specify either unicast or multicast options for identifying a node within the cluster:

* *Unicast*:
+
A unicast cluster requires that you configure the IP addresses of the nodes in the cluster. If a server has multiple interfaces, use the internal IP address that allows the node to communicate directly with other nodes. Clustering across different availability zones or regions can cause a cluster performance issue, as it relies on high speed connectivity. Putting all cluster nodes on one subnet or in the same availability zone reduces performance risks.
+
Because Mule relies on the IP address to identify the server, IP addresses can't be dynamically assigned using DHCP for servers on a unicast cluster. If a server is restarted and uses DHCP to get a new IP address, you must add the server to the cluster using its new IP address.
+
The server status must be Running to be added to a unicast cluster.
* *Multicast*:
+
A multicast cluster comprises servers that automatically detect each other. Servers that are part of a multicast cluster must be on the same network segment.
+
One advantage of multicast clusters is that the server status doesn't need to be Running to configure it as a node in a cluster. Another is that you can add nodes to the cluster dynamically without restarting the cluster.
+
Check with your network administrator to determine if multicast is allowed within your network, because many networks block multicast functionalities.
