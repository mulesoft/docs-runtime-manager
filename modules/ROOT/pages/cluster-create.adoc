To deploy applications to a cluster, you can either add the servers to Runtime Manager first and then create the cluster, or you can create the cluster and add servers to it later.

//CLUSTER-SERVER SHARED
include::partial$cluster-server.adoc[tag=addServerToCluster]


For Object Store persistence on all the servers in your cluster, create your cluster manually and use Quorum Management.


== Restrictions

Before you add servers to a cluster, note the following restrictions:

* Servers cannot contain any previously deployed applications.
* Servers cannot belong to another cluster or group.
* Multicast servers can be in the *Running* or *Disconnected* state.
* Unicast servers must be in the Running state.
* All servers in a cluster must be running the same Mule runtime engine version
(including monthly update) and Runtime Manager agent version.
+
For information about monthly updates, see
xref:cloudhub-app-runtime-version-updates.adoc#monthly-date-patch-updates[Monthly Date-Patch Updates].

. In the *Create Cluster* page, enter the name for the cluster.
+
Cluster names can contain between 3-40 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-). They cannot start or end with a hyphen and cannot contain spaces or other characters.
. Select *Unicast* or *Multicast*.
. Select the servers to include in your new cluster.
. Click the *Create Cluster* button.

The new cluster appears in the *Servers* list. The servers no longer appear in the *Servers* list. To see the list of servers in the cluster, click the cluster name.
