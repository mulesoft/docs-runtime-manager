A replica is an instance of the Flex Gateway. By default, Flex Gateway runs a single replica. Running multiple replicas enables scaling, load balancing, and high availability.

When using Anypoint Flex Gateway to manage APIs in production, you should at least have more than one replica to avoid a single point of failure. Running multiple replicas also increases performance if your API service receives a significant amount of traffic.

See xref:gateway::flex-conn-rep-run[Adding Flex Replicas in Connected Mode] for more details on how to add one or more replicas.

After registering your gateways, you see the replicas associated with them in the Runtime Manager UI.

To see the replicas for each gateway:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Flex Gateway* in the left menu.
. Click the name of the gateway whose replica or replicas you want to visualize.
