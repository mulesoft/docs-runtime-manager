CloudHub is a complete integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that provides server functionality out of the box.
You deploy your apps to CloudHub from the Runtime Manager cloud console without having to configure a hosting environment.
Based on your contract, you control how many resources to assign to your application.

image::infrastructure-simple-cloud.png[ch]

The following features and limitations apply when using Runtime Manager to manage CloudHub deployments:


* *Distributed locks*
+
CloudHub does not coordinate invocations of FTP and File endpoints across multiple workers.

* *High availability*
+
CloudHub provides high availability with the clustering feature, which includes load balancing, persistent message queues, and horizontal scaleout. 
+
See xref:cloudhub-fabric.adoc[Clustering].
+
CloudHub also actively monitors services and workers for problems and corrects issues. For example, in the case of hardware failure, CloudHub auto-migrates the application to a different worker using CloudHub zero downtime updates.

* *JDK versions*
+
The version of JDK that CloudHub implements for all apps built with Mule runtime 3.5.1 or greater is JDK 1.7. Mule runtime 3.7.0 also supports JDK 1.8. Apps built with runtime 3.5.0 or older are deployed with JDK 1.6.
* *Load balancing*
+
If your app runs on multiple workers, the CloudHub shared load automatically balances incoming traffic.
+
Alternatively, you can use the optional dedicated load balancer (DLB) component to
route external traffic to multiple Mule applications deployed to CloudHub workers in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
+
See xref:dedicated-load-balancer-tutorial.adoc[CloudHub Load Balancers].

* *Logging*
+
CloudHub provides a logging service for customizing log levels, searching, and downloading logs.
+
See xref:viewing-log-data.adoc[Viewing Log Data]. 

* *Monitoring*
+
The Runtime Manager cloud console includes dashboards that provide performance metrics for all deployed applications.
+
With Runtime Manager, you can set up alerts based on alert conditions on deployed apps, and standard notifications to inform you when events occur in your applications.
+
You can also set up custom alerts and notifications that are triggered by any event by adding a CloudHub connector to your app's flows.
+
See xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications and Servers].

* *Object store*
+
CloudHub provides a preconfigured default object store that you can reference using the Object Store Connector.
+
See xref:managing-application-data-with-object-stores.adoc[Managing Application Data Storage with Object Stores].
+
One limitation of the CloudHub object store is that idempotent routers work with in-memory stores.

* *Scheduling*
+
You can manage schedules for CloudHub apps using the Runtime Manager UI.
+
See xref:managing-schedules.adoc[Managing Schedules].

* *Security updates*
+
When a security update is available for the runtime version for an app, you can see and apply the update in Runtime Manager. 

* *Shared resource support*
+
Because each application deployed to CloudHub runs on a separate virtual server, you don't need to use domains to share ports or other resources between apps.

* *Troubleshooting*
+
CloudHub provides the Insight troubleshooting tool that provides in-depth visibility into business transactions and events on your Mule apps deployed through Runtime Manager.
+
See xref:insight.adoc[Insight].



== Hybrid

image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-runtime-fabric", title="Runtime Fabric"]

With the hybrid deployment option, you deploy your apps from the Runtime Manager cloud console to your Mule servers and use Runtime Manager to manage them.
This option allows for flexibility and control over your on-premises security but requires you to provide the hosting infrastructure.

To use the hybrid option, you first register your Mule servers with Runtime Manager agent.
Then, from Runtime Manager, you can optionally add those servers to server groups or clusters 
to provide high availability.
Finally, you deploy your applications from Runtime Manager to either a server, server group, or cluster.

image::infrastructure-hybrid.png[hybrid]

The following features and limitations apply when using Runtime Manager to manage hybrid deployments:


* *High availability*
+
For high availability capabilities in hybrid deployments, use server groups or clusters.
Clustered Mule instances have distributed shared memory, which used to provide persistent VM queues, transactions, and cluster-wide data storage.
+
See xref:server-group-about.adoc[Server Groups], xref:cluster-about.adoc[Clusters], and xref:mule-runtime::mule-high-availability-ha-clusters.adoc[Mule Runtime High Availability (HA) Cluster Overview].


* *JDK versions*
+
For hybrid deployments, see the release notes of the Mule runtime engine to determine the minimum JDK supported version.
+
See xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mule-esb.adoc[Mule Runtime Release Notes].

* *Load balancing*
+
Load balancing is not provided for hybrid deployments. 
You can manage load balancing with the tools connected to your on-premises resources.

* *Logging*
+
The Runtime Manager logging feature is not available for hybrid deployments.
You can configure on-premises apps to send data to external analytics tools, such as Splunk or ELK, to manage your logs.
+
See xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[Export Data to External Analytics Tools].


* *Monitoring*
+
The Runtime Manager cloud console includes dashboards that provide performance metrics for all deployed applications.
+
With Runtime Manager, you can set up alerts based on alert conditions on deployed apps, and standard notifications to inform you when events occur in your applications.
You can also create alerts that are triggered by events related to the servers on which they run, such as reaching a certain CPU usage threshold or adding a new node to a cluster.
+
See xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications and Servers].

* *Object store* 
+
The object store infrastructure is not available for hybrid deployments. 
To use object stores, you must configure a database to store data.
+
See xref:connectors::object-store/object-store-connector.adoc[Object Stores].


* *Scheduling*
+
The scheduling feature is not available for hybrid deployments.
To schedule tasks, use the Scheduler Endpoint element in your flows.
+
See xref:mule-runtime::scheduler-concept.adoc[Scheduler Endpoint].

* *Security updates*
+
After an application is deployed and running, you must apply any updates for the selected runtime version manually.


* *Shared resource support*
+
See <<Shared Resource Support for On-Premises App Deployments>>.

* *Troubleshooting*
+
The Insight troubleshooting tool is not available for hybrid deployments.

=== Security for Hybrid Deployments

By default, no application data flows to the cloud, only metadata pushed by the Runtime Manager agent in each Mule runtime engine.

The agent monitors and controls Mule, and publishes its data to the control plane.
You can control Mule from external systems by calling Runtime Manager agent APIs, or specify that Mule publishes its data to external systems.

You can change the default behavior so that the agent pushes IDs, final average numbers, or any data you find useful for monitoring or keeping control of applications.
See xref:runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent]. 

You can also tokenize sensitive data.
See xref:anypoint-security::tokenization-example.adoc[Tokenization Service Components].

== Shared Resource Support for On-Premises App Deployments

image:logo-cloud-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#cloudhub", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#hybrid", title="Hybrid"]
image:logo-server-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-platform-private-cloud-edition", title="Anypoint Platform PCE"]
image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-runtime-fabric", title="Runtime Fabric"]


When deploying on-premises, you can create `Domain` mule projects with no flows and a set of global configuration elements to share among other apps deployed to the same server.

Use this strategy to avoid configuring the same settings and credentials for each application. 
You can also use it to configure multiple applications to listen on the same HTTP host and port, or other exclusive resources. 

See xref:mule-runtime::shared-resources.adoc[Shared Resources].
