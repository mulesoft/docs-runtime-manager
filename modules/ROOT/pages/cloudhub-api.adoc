The CloudHub management API (CloudHub API) enables you to programmatically access the functions of Anypoint Runtime Manager, such as:

* Manage applications:
** Create, deploy, start, stop, list, and delete an application on CloudHub.
** Update application metadata, including the number of workers, Mule runtime engine version, and system properties.
** Retrieve statistics for an application or worker.
** Retrieve application transactions and events for a transaction.
** Check for replay data, replay the flow for a transaction, and delete replay data for an application.
** Manage static IP addresses and release unused IP addresses associated with an application.
** Download the Mule package file for the application.
** Update, enable, disable, or run all or some schedules.


* Manage logs, notifications, and alerts:
** Add, update, or retrieve log levels for an application.
** Download the log file for an application or instance.
** Create, update, or retrieve a notification.
** Mark a notification as read or unread.
** Create, update, or delete an alert triggered by an application.
** Retrieve an alert and alert history.

* Manage load balancers:
** Create, update, or delete a load balancer.
** List load balancers in an organization.
** Test load balancer rules and return the number of the rule applied to the input.

* Manage VPCs and VPNs:
** Create, update, list, and remove a VPC.
** Create or delete a VPN connection.

* Retrieve additional information about:
** Supported Mule versions
** The current organization, including usage statistics
** Workers, including thread dumps and worker regions
** Users, including permissions
** Available domain names



For an interactive reference that includes supported resources, methods, required properties, and expected responses, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/cloudhub-api/[CloudHub API].

The CloudHub API manages only applications deployed to CloudHub, the cloud-based version of Runtime Manager.
To manage on-premises applications using the API, see https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/arm-rest-services[Runtime Manager REST Services].


== Use the CloudHub API

Before getting started, familiarize yourself with operations for applications.

You can use any HTTP client with the CloudHub API.
With Java, use the https://jersey.github.io/[Jersey client] or http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html[HttpClient] with https://github.com/codehaus/jackson[Jackson] for JSON support.


To access operations in the CloudHub API, you must:

include::partial$api-authenticate.adoc[]

=== Get a List of Applications

To get a list of apps deployed to CloudHub, run the following `curl` command:

----
curl -X GET \
  --url https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/applications \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-ANYPNT-ENV-ID: ENV_ID' \
  -H 'X-ANYPNT-ORG-ID: ORG_ID'
----


== Data Format

Resources and methods that return or accept a type use the JSON data format.
Here is an example of data received in JSON format in response to a request to get an application:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "versionId": "xxxxxxxx",
  "domain": "hello",
  "fullDomain": "hello.us-e1.cloudhub.io",
  "properties": {
    "foo":"bar"
  },
  "propertiesOptions": {},
  "status": "STARTED",
  "workers": {
    "type": {
      "name": "Micro",
      "weight": 0.1,
      "cpu": "0.1 vCores",
      "memory": "500 MB memory"
    },
    "amount": 1,
    "remainingOrgWorkers": 223.7,
    "totalOrgWorkers": 1000.0
  },
  "workerStatuses": [
    {
      "id": "i-xxxxxxxx",
      "host": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
      "port": 0,
      "status": "STARTED",
      "deployedRegion": "us-east-1",
      "staticIPEnabled": false
    }
  ],
  "lastUpdateTime": 1589868960908,
  "fileName": "hello.zip",
  "muleVersion": {
    "version": "4.3.0",
    "updateId": "xxxxxxxx",
    "latestUpdateId": "xxxxxxxx",
    "endOfSupportDate": 1633737600000
  },
  ...
}

== Rate Limits

The CloudHub management API enforces global usage limits, with some exceptions.


=== Global Rate Limits for the CloudHub Management API

The following table lists the rate limits for the CloudHub management API endpoints except those listed in <<Exceptions to the Global Rate Limits>>.

When the app reaches the rate limit, CloudHub returns a 503 status code.

[%header,cols="20,20,20,10"]
|===
|Endpoints |Control Plane | Rate Limit Per Client IP Address | Status Code
.3+|All except specified endpoints|U.S.|75 requests per second  .3+| `503`
|EU .2+| 25 requests per second
|Government Cloud
|===


=== Exceptions to the Global Rate Limits

The following table lists the exceptions to the <<Global Rate Limits for the CloudHub Management API>>.

When the app reaches the rate limit, CloudHub returns the status codes shown here.

[%header,cols="20,20,20,10"]
|===
|Endpoints|Control Plane | Rate Limit Per Client IP Address| Status Code
4+|*Endpoints under* `/api`
.3+|`/notifications`|U.S.|75 requests per minute .3+| `503`
|EU .2+|25 requests per minute
|Government Cloud
4+|*Endpoints under* `*v2/applications/{domain}*`
|`/logs` .4+|All .3+|10 requests per second  .3+| `429`
|`/deployments/{deploymentId}/logs`
|`/instances/{instanceId}/logs`
|`/instances/{instanceId}/log-file`|1 request per minute  | `500`
|===



== Status Codes and Error Handling

When you call the CloudHub API, the following status codes are returned:

[%header,cols="10a,50a"]
|===
|Status Code |Description
|200 |The operation was successful.
|201 |The resource (such as an application) was created.

The `Location` header contains the location of the resource.
|404 |The resource was not found.
|409 |When creating a resource (such as a server, server group, or deployment), a resource with that name already exists.
|429 a|The operation was unsuccessful due to reaching the rate limit.
|500 |The operation was unsuccessful.

See the HTTP body for details.
|503 |The operation was unsuccessful due to a temporary condition, such as server overload or reaching a rate limit.

Retry the operation.
|===

When errors occur, such as a 500 status code, the HTTP response contains a JSON response with an error message:

[source,json,linenums]
----
500
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Date: Mon, 10 Aug 2015 00:12:55 GMT

{
  message : "Some error message."
}
----
