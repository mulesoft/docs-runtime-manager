To add a server to a cluster, all servers in a cluster must run the same version of Mule runtime and of the Runtime Manager Agent.

[NOTE]
Remember that you must first <<Add a Server, register>> each of the servers in the cluster, by downloading and installing the same version of the https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule[Mule runtime] and then running the xref:managing-servers.adoc#add-a-server[amc_setup] script on each.
A cluster can only be made up of servers that are not already in a server group or part of another cluster.


. In the Runtime Manager Servers tab, click the name of a cluster to open the details view.
