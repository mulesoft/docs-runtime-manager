You can connect a Virtual Private Cloud to your private network using any of these methods:

== IPsec tunnel with network-to-network configuration.

This method is used to connect your on-prem data centers to your CloudHub VPC. It uses  an IPsec VPN tunnel which, in general, is the recommended solution for VPC to on-premise connectivity. It provides a standardized, secure way to connect, which integrates well with existing IT infrastructure such as routers/appliances.
