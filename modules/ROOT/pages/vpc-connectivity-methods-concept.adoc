You can connect an Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) to your private network using an IPsec tunnel, VPC peering, and CloudHub Direct Connect.

[NOTE]
A maximum of 95 route table entries is allowed per VPC, regardless of the number of connections. To avoid exceeding the limit, consolidate networks to the fewest number possible.

== IPsec Tunnel

You can use an IPsec tunnel with network-to-network configuration to connect your on-premises data centers to your Anypoint VPC. An IPsec VPN tunnel is generally the recommended solution for VPC to on-premises connectivity, as it provides a standardized, secure way to connect. This method also integrates well with existing IT infrastructure such as routers and appliances.

To create an Anypoint VPN connection to your network, see xref:vpn-about.adoc[Anypoint VPN].

==  VPC Peering

VPC peering provides a connection between two VPCs. In this case, it pairs your private Amazon VPC directly to your Anypoint VPC. This enables you to route traffic between the two VPCs so they can communicate as though they are in the same network.

[NOTE]
--
To use VPC Peering, your AWS and Anypoint VPCs must be located in the same region.

== CloudHub Direct Connect

This method establishes a dedicated network connection from your Amazon account to your Anypoint VPC. This enables you to create a hosted virtual interface to attach to your Anypoint VPC.

[NOTE]
--
To use Direct Connect, your AWS Direct Connect Partner and the Anypoint VPCs must be located in the same region. Direct Connect gateways are not supported.
Direct Connect requires the use of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for dynamic routing.

For high availability, use multiple Direct Connect connections from different AWS Direct Connect Locations.
