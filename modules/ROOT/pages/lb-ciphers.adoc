When you create HTTPS endpoint in your Mule applications, please have in mind that there is a list of allowed ciphers that will used to create the upstream connection between your dedicated load balancer and your Mule application.

If your Mule application is using a cipher that is not allowed for the load balancer to stablish the connection, the request will fail.

== Ciphers used in your Mule applications

In order to check which ciphers are being used by your application, you can always use Anypoint Studio.

. Open you Mule application project
. Select any of your endpoints listeners and check your *Connector Configuration* by clicking on the *Edit* button.
. Once the window is opened, check the *TLS* tab
. If your application is using for *TLS Configuration* the *Edit inline* option, you will find the ciphers enabled for your application in the *Enabled Cipher Suites* section
. If your application is using for *TLS Configuration* the *Global reference* option, you will find the ciphers enabled for your application by clicking the *Edit* option and then checking the *Enabled Cipher Suites* section


== Ciphers allowed for stablish connection between Dedicated Load Balancers and Applications

Cloudhub is alowing a total of 167 cipher suites.

Please check the cipher suites allowed in the following link:
xref:lb-all-ciphers.adoc[Dedicated Load Balancer all ciphers allowed]

== Future ciphers allowed for stablish connection between Dedicated Load Balancers and Applications

Even though Cloudhub allows a total of 167 cipher suites, it is strongly recommended to use more secure ciphers for your connections.

In the future, cloudhub will only allow a total of only 60 cipher suites that are considered much more secured.

Please check the cipher suites that are consired secured:
xref:lb-default-ciphers.adoc[Dedicated Load Balancer secured ciphers allowed]
