Use Anypoint Runtime Manager to add a transit gateway and connect your MuleSoft Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to your private corporate network.

== Prerequisites

Before you can add a transit gateway to CloudHub:

* Create a transit gateway on your corporate AWS account.
+
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-getting-started.html[Getting started with transit gateways^] in the AWS documentation for information about creating a transit gateway on AWS.
+
* You will be able to avail this feature if you have Anypoint VPN licenses. Attaching 1 VPC to a Transit Gateway uses 1 Anypoint VPN license.
+
The *Transit Gateways* page is visible in Runtime Manager to Anypoint organizations that have Anypoint VPC/VPN license . 
* Sign in to an Anypoint Platform account with either the CloudHub Network Administrator or the CloudHub Network Viewer user permission.
+
See xref:access-management::users.adoc#granting-permissions-and-roles-to-users[Granting Permissions and Roles to Users].
* Create an Anypoint VPC in Anypoint Platform.
+
See xref:vpc-tutorial.adoc[Create and Update a VPC for Runtime Manager].

* Identify the subnets in your network (in CIDR notation) that you want to make accessible through the transit gateway.


== Transit Gateway Workflow 

The steps for adding a transit gateway to your VPC are:

. <<add_tgw,Add the transit gateway>> to Anypoint Platform by <<create_resource_share,creating a resource share in AWS>> to share your transit gateway with Anypoint Platform.
. <<attach_vpc_tgw,Attach your VPCs>> to the transit gateway and <<accept_attachment,accept the VPC attachments>> in AWS.
. <<enable_outbound_traffic_from_vpc,Enable outbound traffic from the Anypoint VPC>>. 
. <<enable_inbound_traffic_on_aws,Enable inbound traffic through the transit gateway on AWS>>.


[[add_tgw]]

+
_update screenshot - styles changed_
+
image::tgw-add.png[Add transit gateway page]
+
The Transit Gateway name reference in Anypoint Platform needs to be unique, however, we recommend referencing your AWS Transit Gateway name within this name to simplify associating the two.You can change this name later.

The name can contain up to 255 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-).
// They cannot start or end with a hyphen and cannot contain spaces or other characters.
. Select the region that corresponds to the location of your AWS transit gateway.
+
See xref:cloudhub-networking-guide.adoc#regional-services[Regional Services].
+
Your VPC and AWS transit gateway must be in the same region.
. Click *Next*.
+
The *Add transit gateway* page lists the steps to create a resource share in AWS:
+
_update screenshot - styles changed_
+
image::tgw-add-overview.png[Add transit gateway page: Steps to create a resource share]
+

+
--
.. Under *Description*, enter a descriptive name for the resource share in the *Name* field.
.. Under *Resources - _optional_*, select *Transit Gateways* from the *Select resource type* menu and select the transit gateway resource to share.
+
The transit gateway ID appears in the *Selected resources* field.
.. Under *Principals - _optional_*, ensure that *Allow external accounts* is selected, 
enter the MuleSoft AWS account ID that appears on the *Add transit gateway* page, and click *Add*.
+
The AWS account number appears in the *Selected principals* field.
.. Under *Tags*, add a tag if you want.
.. Click *Create resource share*.
.. Copy the *ID* and *Owner* values for the resource share you just created. 
--
. In Anypoint Platform, in the *Add transit gateway* window: 
+
--
.. Click *Next*.
.. Paste the values you copied from AWS in the *ID* and *Owner* fields:
+
_update screenshot - styles changed_
+
image::tgw-add-resource-share.png[Add transit gateway page: Resource share ID and owner ID]

*** The resource share *ID* field contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-).
*** The resource share *Owner* field contains only numbers.

.. Click *Add*.
--
+
The *Transit Gateways* page shows the progress for connecting to AWS and adding the transit gateway to Anypoint Platform.

When the transit gateway addition succeeds, the *Transit Gateways* page displays the *Transit gateway added* message.
The *Transit Gateways* page updates the owner and ID from AWS and the state as *Available*:

If the transit gateway addition fails, see xref:tgw-troubleshoot.adoc[Troubleshoot Transit Gateway Attachments].



[[attach_vpc_tgw]]
== Attach a VPC to the Transit Gateway

After the transit gateway attachment succeeds, attach your Anypoint VPC to enable apps to access the transit gateway.

For information about limitations when attaching a VPC to a transit gateway, 
see 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html[Transit gateway attachments to a VPC^] in the AWS documentation.

To attach a VPC to the transit gateway:

. In Anypoint Platform, on the *Transit Gateways* page, click *Attach VPC*.
+
The *Attach VPC* button is disabled if no VPCs are available to attach or if the transit gateway addition failed. 
. From the *Select VPC* window, select the VPC to attach:
+
_Add screenshot?_
+
The window displays only the VPCs that are:
+
--
* In the same region as the transit gateway
* Not already attached to the transit gateway
// Can VPCs be added to multiple transit gateways?
* In business groups for which you have CloudHub Network Administrator permissions
--
. Click *Next*.

[[accept_attachment]]
== Accept the VPC Attachment

. Sign in to your AWS corporate account.
. In Anypoint Platform, on the *Accept VPC Attachment* page, click the *Transit Gateway Attachments* link:
+
_Add screenshot?_
+
The link opens the AWS RAM console to the *Create Transit Gateway Attachment* page.
. In the AWS console:
+
.. Select the attachment that shows *pending acceptance* in the *State* column.
+
The attachment might take a few minutes to appear.
+
.. Select the Transit Gateway attachment ID and, on the *Details* tab, ensure that *Resource owner account ID* is the MuleSoft AWS account ID.
.. Click the pencil icon for the attachment and enter a name. 
.. Select *Actions* > *Accept* and click *Accept* to confirm.
+
When the attachment acceptance succeeds, the *State* column shows *available*.
. In Anypoint Platform, in the *Accept VPC Attachment* window, click *Done*.
+
The *Transit Gateways* page shows the progress for accepting the VPC attachment from Anypoint Platform to AWS:
+
_Add screenshot?_
. Click *Refresh* to update the attachment status.

When the VPC attachment succeeds, the *Transit Gateways* page displays the *VPC attached* message and the attachment state indicates that it's attached to Transit Gateway:

_Update screenshot - details and styling changed_

image::tgw-attached.png[VPC attached successfully]

If the VPC attachment state is `Rejected`, see xref:tgw-troubleshoot.adoc[Troubleshoot Transit Gateway Attachments].



[[enable_outbound_traffic_from_vpc]]
== Enable Outbound Traffic from the VPC

After attaching the VPC, enable outbound traffic from the VPC to an external destination so that apps can access the transit gateway and the transit gateway routes traffic correctly.

A maximum of 95 route table entries is permitted per VPC, regardless of the number of transit gateway attachments.
Consolidate networks to the fewest number possible to avoid exceeding the limit.  

To do this, add routes to the transit gateway route table:

. In Anypoint Platform, on the *Transit Gateways* page, in the *VPCs* section, click *Add Route*. 
. On the *Add VPC Route* window, use CIDR notation to enter a single subnet for your
AWS VPC:
+
_Update screenshot - title, text, and style changed_
+
image::tgw-add-vpc-route.png[Add VPC route]
+
For information about routing, see xref:tgw-about.adoc#routing[Transit Gateway Routing].
. Click *Add Route*.
+
Anypoint Platform submits the new route to AWS.

When the route addition succeeds, the *Transit Gateways* page shows the *Route added* message
and the *Transit Gateways* page shows the route CIDR in the route table.

In the route table, added routes show *Transit Gateway* as the value in the *Next Hop* column:

[[enable_inbound_traffic_on_aws]]
== Enable Inbound Traffic Through the Transit Gateway

After successfully adding routes to the transit gateway route table in Anypoint Platform, enable inbound traffic through your transit gateway on AWS. 

You might need to coordinate with your network administrator to enable inbound traffic.
