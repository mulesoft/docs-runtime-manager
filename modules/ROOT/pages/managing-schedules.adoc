You can use Runtime Manager to view and control the Scheduler components within the flows in your deployed applications.
Use the *Schedules* tab in the left navigation menu to enable or disable Scheduler elements,
change the frequency, or run the scheduled job immediately,
all without changing the running application.

The *Schedules* tab is useful in the following scenarios:

* You have a job that runs nightly but you want to debug it now.
+
You can trigger the job while it's running without updating the schedule in your application.
* You want to change the schedules in your application at runtime without redeploying.
* You want to disable a scheduled job while one of the applications you are connecting to is undergoing maintenance.
* You want runtime visibility into the schedules in your application.

== Considerations and Limitations

When using the *Schedules* tab, consider the following:

* CloudHub manages the Schedulers and triggers them in only one worker, even if more are available.
* All schedules are based in the UTC timezone, regardless of the geographic region where your
application is deployed.
* The minimum recommended frequency is 10 seconds between calls.
* If a scheduled job is not triggered because the application is not running,
CloudHub triggers the job as soon as the application restarts.
* When a schedule is used to trigger a flow with subflow in a Mule 4.x application, it waits until both main flow and subflow complete before scheduling the next run.
* The CloudHub scheduler reads the job configuration every time it runs.
+
When you update the scheduler configuration, the change takes effect the next time the scheduler runs.
* If the execution time for a job is longer than 12 hours, network issues occur, or the infrastructure restarts due to hardware issues or scheduled maintenance, the scheduler fails and is re-executed.
* You cannot manage CloudHub schedules using scripts.
+
Use the CloudHub API or *Schedules* tab in Runtime Manager to manage CloudHub schedules.

== View and Manage Application Schedules in Runtime Manager

To use the scheduling feature in Runtime Manager, deploy an application that includes one or more Scheduler elements:

.The arrow shows the *Scheduler* component in the Anypoint Studio canvas.

You can download this example app from Exchange.

After deploying an app to CloudHub, view and manage the Scheduler elements in Runtime Manager:

. Click *Applications* in the left pane, click the app, and then click *Schedules*:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Logs* option, (*2*) the *Last Run* column, and (*3*) the frequency link on the *Schedules* page.
image::cloudhub-scheduler-rtm.png[Logs option, the Last Run column, and the frequency link on the Schedules page]
+
The *Last Run* column shows the date and time each Scheduler element last ran.
You can click *Logs* in the left navigation menu to see more information about when the jobs started and ended scheduled runs.
+
Runtime Manager lists the Scheduler elements in the order that they appear in your application.
. Select the elements to manage and then:

** Click *Run now* to override the schedule and run the job immediately.
+
** Click *Disable* to suspend a Scheduler element.
+
CloudHub does not run the scheduled job until you reenable it.
** Click the frequency link in the *Schedule* column to open the schedule editor:
+
.The arrow shows the *Switch to advanced mode* link in the schedule editor.
image::cloudhub-scheduler-frequency.png[Switch to advanced mode link in the schedule editor]
+
In the schedule editor, change the frequency of the schedule or deselect *Enabled* to disable the schedule.
+
The value for the frequency can be between 1 and 100 seconds.
+
You can also switch to advanced mode to use cron expressions to create more specific schedules,
such as every Thursday at 3:00 pm.
. Click *Update* to save changed settings or click *Cancel* to exit without saving.

== Use Cron Expressions

With cron expressions, you can create more complex schedule frequencies,
such as every 5 minutes between 9:00 am and 10:00 on Fridays.

To use cron expressions to specify the schedule frequency:

. In the schedule editor, click *Switch to advanced mode*.
. In the advanced mode page, click *Quick reference* to expand or collapse the table that lists required fields and allowed values:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Quick reference* toggle, (*2*) the *more* link, and the *Switch to basic mode* link on the advanced mode page.
image::cloudhub-scheduler-cron.png[Quick reference toggle, the more link, and the Switch to basic mode link on the advanced mode page]
+
The cron expression in this example sets the schedule to every 10 seconds.
+
On this page:

* Click *more* to view the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation[Quartz documentation] for information about building cron triggers.
+
Select a version, click *Documentation > User's Guide > Tutorial*, and then click the *CronTrigger* lesson.
+
[NOTE]
Because all schedules are based in the UTC timezone, the timezone configuration is ignored.
* Click *Switch to basic mode* to exit advanced mode.
. Click *Update* to save changed cron settings or click *Cancel* to exit without saving.
