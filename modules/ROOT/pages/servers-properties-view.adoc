Runtime Manager enables you to view and configure properties in your Mule environments. Runtime Manager displays both custom and discovered properties.

== Custom Properties

Custom properties enable you to define properties used by the JVM container of a Mule instance. Custom properties are defined as key-value pairs.

== Discovered Properties

Discovered properties are properties defined by the remote environment of the Mule instance. These properties include:

* JVM arguments
* Environment properties
* System properties

Runtime Manager retrieves the values of these properties from Runtime Manager agent which queries the `System` Java class on the remote server. 

By default, auto-discovery of remote server properties is disabled. To use this feature, click *Enable Auto-Discovery*. After enabling this feature, Runtime Manager stores an encrypted version of these properties in its internal database.

You can fully disable this feature to prevent Runtime Manager from storing discovered properties. Contact your MuleSoft customer success representative.
