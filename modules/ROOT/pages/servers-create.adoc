= Create a Server in Runtime Manager (Hybrid)

Use the `amc_setup` script to create a server by configuring the Runtime Manager Agent to communicate with Runtime Manager. To make a server visible in the Runtime Manager console so you can manage it, you must first register it with the Runtime Manager Agent.

== Prerequisites

To manage servers in a customer-hosted environment, you must perform the following:

* Install Mule version 3.6 or later, or API gateway version 2.0 or later.
* Install Runtime Manager Agent, version 1.1.1 or later.
* (Optional) Configure any whitelisted IPs or ports required to connect to Anypoint Platform through a firewall.

If the server you want to add is already registered with a different instance of Runtime Manager, you cannot add it until you remove if from the other instance. To do this:

. In Runtime Manager, delete the server from the *Server* tab.
. Delete the `mule-agent.yaml` configuration file, which can be found in your `{RUNTIME PARENT FOLDER}/conf` folder.

If your environment requires all outbound calls to go through a proxy you must modify the proxy settings in the `wrapper.conf` file in the `{RUNTIME PARENT FOLDER}/conf` directory.

If you have previously configured your runtime environment you must delete the server and its corresponding configuration file.
. Delete the server from Runtime Manager.
. Remove the `mule-agent.yml` file from the `$MULE_HOME/conf` directory.


=== The amc_setup Command

The `amc_setup` command is located in the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory. If you do not run the command from this directory, you must do one of the following:

* Set the `MULE_HOME` environment variable before running the command
* Use the `--mule-home` parameter as shown in the following example:
+
----
/opt/mule-3.7.0/bin/amc_setup --mule-home /opt/mule-3.7.0 -H ...
----

The `amc_setup` script calls the Runtime Manager Agent installation script, which has several useful parameters for configuring security and proxies.

=== The Server Registration Token

The registration token provided by Runtime Manager, which is included in the command with the `-H` parameter, is specific to a single environment. For example, if you register a server in a QA environment by clicking *Add Server*, Runtime Manager provides a token. However, if you try to register the server in your production environment, Runtime Manager generates a different token. Tokens are specific to the environment where you register a server. You can only use a token to register multiple Mules if all servers are in the same environment.

=== The IBM JVM

When creating a server using IBM's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) you must use a different truststore than the default truststore installed by the Runtime Manager Agent.

. Download the custom truststore from the customer support portal.
. Rename the file to `truststore.jks`.
. Copy the custom truststore into the Runtime Manager Agent `<MULE_HOME>/conf` folder.
. Restart the Mule runtime.

== Creating a Server

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. If you have previously created a server in this environment, click *Create Server*.
. Copy the full `amc_setup` script, including your unique token for your Runtime Manager environment.

The `amc_setup` command contains information that is unique to your organization. Running this command enables the Mule server to communicate with Runtime Manager. The key included in the `-H` parameter (partly redacted in the image above) is a token generated specifically for Mule or API gateway to authenticate against Runtime Manager.

. Login to the environment where your Mule runtime is installed.
. Navigate to the `$MULESOFT_HOME/bin` directory.
. Paste the command in your terminal window, substituting `server-name` with name of your server, for example:
+
----
./amc_setup -H 17958da2-[redacted]---1942 my_server
----
+
If you are running Windows, substitute `amc_setup.bat` for `./amc_setup`.

. Press Enter to run the command.

If the `amc_setup` command is successful, you should see the following output:

----
Mule Agent configured successfully
Connecting to Access Management to extract client_id and client_secret
Credentials extracted correctly, updating wrapper conf file
----

After the script completes successfully, your server is listed in the Servers tab of Runtime Manager. The status should be Created.

If the server was running when you ran the `amc_setup` script, it must be restarted for it to start communicating with Runtime Manager.
