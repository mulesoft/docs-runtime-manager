To add a Mule server to the Runtime Manager console so that you can manage it, you must first register it with the Runtime Manager agent. Use the `amc_setup` script to configure the Runtime Manager agent to communicate with Runtime Manager.


== Prerequisites

* Your enterprise license is current.
* You are running Mule 3.6.0 or later, and API gateway 2.1 or later.
+
For Mule 3.6.x, install the Runtime Manager agent.
+
For information, see xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Install or Update the Runtime Manager Agent].
* If you must download the agent, you have an Enterprise support account.
* If the server is already registered with another Runtime Manager instance, remove that registration first.

== Add a Server

To add a Mule server to Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Servers* in the left menu.
. Click the *Add Server* button.
. Enter a name for your server.
+
include::partial$cluster-server.adoc[tag=ServerNameReqs]
+
include::partial$cluster-server.adoc[tag=ServerNameUnique]
+
include::partial$cluster-server.adoc[tag=AMCsetupInfo]
+
.The arrow shows the `amc_setup` command in the *Add Server* window.
image::rtm-add-server.png[amc_setup command in the Add Server window]
+
. Click *Copy command* to copy the `amc_setup` command.
+
This button appears only if the server name you specify is valid.
. In a terminal window, change to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory for the Mule instance that you're registering.
. Paste the command on the command line.
. Include any other parameters on the `amc_setup` command line.
+
For information, see xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc#amc_setup-parameters[amc_setup Parameters].
. If your environment requires all outbound calls to go through a proxy, specify proxy settings in either the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file or the `$MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf` file.
+
See xref:rtm-agent-proxy-config.adoc[Connect the Agent Through a Proxy Server].
. If you are using the IBM JVM, see <<IBM JVM>>.

When the `amc_setup` command completes successfully, you see:

----
Mule Agent configured successfully
Connecting to Access Management to extract client_id and client_secret
Credentials extracted correctly, updating wrapper conf file
----

After the script completes successfully, the name of your server appears on the *Servers* tab of Runtime Manager with a status of `Created`.

If the server was running when you ran the `amc_setup` script, restart the server to reconnect with Runtime Manager.

== IBM JVM

When creating a server using the IBM Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you must use a different truststore file than the default truststore installed by the Runtime Manager agent.

. Download the custom truststore from this knowledgebase article:
+
https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Connectivity-issues-between-Mule-Runtime-and-Anypoint-Runtime-manager-using-an-IBM-JVM[Connectivity issues between Mule and Anypoint Runtime Manager using an IBM JVM]
. Depending on your Mule version, rename the `truststore` file in `$MULE_HOME/conf` to one of these file names:
* `anypoint-truststore.jks`
+
Mule 4.1.3 (Agent 2.1.4) and later
* `truststore.jks`
+
Mule 4.1.2 (Agent 2.1.3)
. Copy the custom truststore into the `$MULE_HOME/conf` folder.
. Restart Mule.

== Remove a Server from Another Runtime Manager Instance

If the server you want to add is already registered with a different instance of Runtime Manager, you must remove it before you can register.

To remove the server from Runtime Manager:

. In Runtime Manager, delete the server from the *Server* tab.
+
See xref:servers-actions.adoc[Shut Down, Restart, or Delete Servers].
. In the `$MULE_HOME/conf` directory, delete the `mule-agent.yaml` and `mule-agent.jks` files.
