Anypoint Platform provides a scripting and command line tool for both *Anypoint Platform* and *Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition*.
The CLI supports both interactive shell and standard CLI modes, and works with:

* xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange]
* xref:access-management::index.adoc[Access Management]
* xref:index.adoc[Runtime Manager] for Mule applications deployed to MuleSoft-hosted (CloudHub) and customer-hosted Mule runtimes
* xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc[VPCs]
* xref:cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer.adoc[Cloudhub load balancers]
* xref:1.x@api-manager::index.adoc[API Manager 1.x (pre Crowd Release)]
* xref:design-center::index.adoc[Design Center]

== Prerequisites

Anypoint-CLI is a Node.js application. To install Anypoint CLI on your computer you need to make sure that you have the Node.js runtime environment installed on your computer, along with NPM, the default Node.js package manager.
Follow the NodeJS documentation to get both resources.

Additionally, you  also need to install the Git version management system on your computer. Installation instructions and links to downloads for your particular Operating System are available at the Git Documentation site.

After you have installed Node.js (with npm) and git, you can install Anypoint CLI by opening a command-line interface and typing:

== Installation

Depending on the configuration of your system, you might have to run these commands using administrator's credentials.

[source]
----
$ npm install -g anypoint-cli@2.4.0
----

[NOTE]
--
If during the installation process, npm throws a `fatal: read error: Invalid argument` error, make sure that the git client installed on your computer, and that the git protocol is not blocked by your firewall or network.
--

== Reference

Every instance of Anypoint-CLI takes any of the following options:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description | Required
|username | Your Anypoint Platform username.

You can also pass this value using a the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_USERNAME=<name>` | *Yes*

|password | Your Anypoint Platform password.

You can also pass this value using the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_PASSWORD=<pwd>` | *Yes*

|organization | Your organization within Anypoint Platform.

You can also pass this value using the environment variable ` export ANYPOINT_ORG=<name>` | No

|environment | Your Anypoint environment.

You can also pass this value using the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_ENV=<name>` | No

|host | The host of your Anypoint Platform Installation. +
By default, this value points to +https://anypoint.mulesoft.com+. +
If you are using Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition make sure to pass the address where you are hosting the platform.
If you are using Anypoint Platform EU Cloud, make sure you pass your EU complaint URL.

You can also pass this value using a dedicated environment variable `ANYPOINT_HOST=<name>` | No

|bearer | Instead of passing your username and password, you can choose to pass the token for your account. +
You can get the token for your account by hitting the +https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login+ endpoint with your username and password to get your bearer value.

Your session expires when the token bearer expires. +
If you send both username and password, and the token bearer, the CLI prioritizes the bearer login.
| No
|===

== Usage

=== Credentials File

The recommended way of passing these options to your Anypoint CLI installation is using the `credentials` file located inside the `./anypoint/` directory, which is not automatically created during installation. Follow these steps to create your credentials file:

. Create a directory called `.anypoint` in the `~/` directory for Linux and OSx, or `C:\Users\USERNAME \` in Windows.
. Navigate to your `.anypoint` directory and create a blank file named `credentials` with the following structure:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
{
 "default": {
  "username": "yourAnypointUserName",
  "password": "yourAnypointPassword",
  "organization": "",
  "environment": "",
  "host": ""
 },
 "otherProfile": {
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "organization": "",
  "environment": "",
  "host": ""
 }
}
----
Note that the "default" profile is used unless the `ANYPOINT_PROFILE` environment variable is set:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
> export ANYPOINT_PROFILE="otherProfile"
> anypoint-cli
----

Then run the anypoint-cli command without any options:

[source,text,linenums]
----
> anypoint-cli
----

=== Dedicated Environment Variables

If you choose to pass the credentials when running Anypoint-CLI, we strongly recommend passing both parameters as environment variables: `ANYPOINT_USERNAME` and `ANYPOINT_PASSWORD`.

[source,text,linenums]
----
> export ANYPOINT_USERNAME="username"
> export ANYPOINT_PASSWORD="password"
> anypoint-cli
----

=== CLI Options

As instructed above, the username and password parameters are required. However, if you choose to pass your username, Anypoint Platform CLI prompts for your password.

[source,text,linenums]
----
> anypoint-cli --username="user"
Password: ****
----

== Passing Commands

After setting up a proper way to access Anypoint Platform from the CLI, you can start passgin commands. +
See xref:anypoint-platform-cli2-commands.adoc[Anypoint Platform CLI 2.x List of Commands] for instructions on how to use them.

== Considerations

A few considerations to keep in mind while using Anypoint-CLI:

. Environment variables override credentials file parameters and Command line parameters override environment variables. +
If you don't pass a command line parameter, the default profile properties are used.
. If you don't set an environment, you will be automatically sent to `production`. +
. Your Anypoint session expires based on the *Default session timeout* configured in your xref:access-management::organization.adoc#manage-the-master-organization-s-settings[Master Organization's settings]. +
. Anypoint-CLI works with autocomplete. You can start typing the name of the command or parameter and hit `tab` for an autocomplete, or double tap `tab` for a list of all possible options.

== List of Commands

Anypoint Platform CLI provides commands for different use case scenarios:

* <<Commands For Administrating your Anypoint Platform Account>>
* <<Commands for API Manager>>
* <<Commands for Administrating your Design Center Applications>>
* <<Commands for Managing Exchange Assets>>
* <<Commands for Administrating your CloudHub Application>>

[TIP]
--
The Anypoint Platform CLI provides three default options:

* The `--help` option displays usage information of the command.
* The `-o` or `--output` option lets you specify the command's output to the defined format. +
Supported values are `table`, `text`, and `json`. Defaults to `text` for non-interactive mode and `table` for interactive sessions.
* The `-f` or `--fields` option allows you to define which fields to output. +
You can pass the `--fields` option after a command to get a list of all possible fields to output.
