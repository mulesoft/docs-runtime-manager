You can configure the Runtime Manager agent to export data to external analytics tools.

Using either the Runtime Manager cloud console or Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you can:

* Send Mule event notifications, including flow executions and exceptions, to Splunk or ELK.
+
See <<Integrate with Splunk>> and <<Integrate with Your ELK Stack>>.
* Send API Analytics to Splunk or ELK.
+
See <<Integrate API Analytics with Splunk or ELK>>.


If you plan to export your payload's contents to be logged, consider that not all formats can be exported.
See xref:about-logging-of-payload-formats.adoc[Payload Formats and Logging].

Sending data to third-party tools is not supported for applications deployed on xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub].
You can use the CloudHub custom log appender to integrate with your logging system. 
See xref:custom-log-appender.adoc[Integrate with Your Logging System Using Log4j].


== Prerequisites

Ensure that the following software is installed:

* Mule runtime engine version 3.6 or later
+
To forward events from API analytics to both an external tool and Anypoint Platform, the following versions are required:
+
** Mule version 4.2.0 or later 
** Mule version 3.9.3 or later 

* API gateway standalone version 2.1.0 or later
* Runtime Manager agent 1.2.0 or later
+
To send data to Splunk using the HTTP Event Collector or over TCP, Runtime Manager agent 1.3.1 or later is required.
+
For information about updating the agent, see xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Install or Update the Runtime Manager Agent].

=== Splunk Prerequisites 

To send data to Splunk using the HTTP Event Collector, you must first set up the data input and obtain a token from Splunk:

. Sign in to your Splunk account.
. Navigate to *Settings* > *Data Inputs*.
. For the *HTTP Event Collector* type, click *Add new*.
+
.The arrow shows the *Add new* option for the HTTP Event Collector in the Splunk Data Inputs page.
image::hybrid-export-splunk-config-http-collector.png[Add new option for the HTTP Event Collector in the Splunk Data Inputs page]

. Follow the steps to set up the data input and obtain the token.

To send data to Splunk over TCP, you must first enable the input source in Splunk:

. Sign in to your Splunk account.
. Navigate to *Settings* > *Data Inputs*.
. For the *TCP* type, click *Add new*.
+
.The arrow shows the *Add new* option for TCP in the Splunk Data Inputs page.
image::hybrid-export-splunk-config-tcp.png[Add new option for TCP in the Splunk Data Inputs page]
. Follow the steps to set up the data input.

For more information about setting up data inputs, see the https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.2/Data/WhatSplunkcanmonitor[Splunk documentation].

== Logging-Level Options 

The following logging levels are available when configuring integration with Splunk or ELK:

Business Events::
Flow start or end, async messages, exceptions, and custom events
Tracking::
Business Events plus exception strategy, and endpoint messages
Debug::
Tracking plus message processor begin and end

== Integrate with Splunk

With http://www.splunk.com/[Splunk], you can capture and index Mule event notification data into a searchable repository from which you can then generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards, and visualizations.


. <<Configure the Agent in Your Splunk Instance>>. 
. <<Configure Splunk Integration in Runtime Manager>>. 

=== Configure the Agent in Your Splunk Instance 

To integrate with Splunk, you must create and configure a new source type on your Splunk instance that can parse the HTTP events sent by the Runtime Manager agent.

. If necessary, create the `$SPLUNK_HOME/opt/splunk/etc/system/local/props.conf` file.
. Append the following source type to the `props.conf` file:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
[mule]
TRUNCATE = 0
LINE_BREAKER = ([\r\n]+)
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS = JSON
KV_MODE = JSON
category = Mule Splunk Integration
description = Mule Agent event information
----

. Restart your Splunk instance for your changes to take effect.

== Integrate with Your ELK Stack

The ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack enables you to store, search, and analyze the log data.


You can configure the Runtime Manager agent to send event notifications from Mule flows to a configurable log file.
Logstash first captures and indexes the data.
Then, you can use Elasticsearch and Kibana to generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards, and visualizations.

=== Configure the Log File for Your ELK Stack

To send event notifications to the folder from which your ELK stack reads:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Click the *Type* column to display the details pane for the server you want to configure.
. Click *Manage Server*.
. Click the *Plugins* tab:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Event Tracking* options, (*2*) the *Level* menu, and (*3*) the gear icon on the server *Plugins* tab.
image::hybrid-export-splunk-elk.png[Event Tracking options, Level menu, and gear icon on the server Plugins tab.]

. Select the type of information to send from the *Level* menu.
+
See <<Logging-Level Options>>.
. Under *Event Tracking*, enable *ELK*.
. Click the gear icon to configure the log file location for ELK:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the log file location and (*2*) the *Show more options* switch in the ELK configuration window.
image::hybrid-export-elk-configure.png[Log file location and Show more options switch in the ELK configuration window]
+
The default location is `$MULE_HOME/logs/events.log` where `$MULE_HOME` is the location specified by the `-Dmule.home` parameter in the `wrapper.conf` file.
To change the default location, specify the absolute path for the location of your ELK log file,
such as `/var/logs/elk/events.log`.
The specified directory, such as `/var/logs/elk`, must exist.
. If you want, click *Show more options* to specify additional properties for the log file:
+
.The arrow shows the expanded options in the ELK configuration window.
image::hybrid-export-elk-configure-advanced.png[Expanded options in the ELK configuration window]


. Click *Apply* to save your changes.


== Integrate API Analytics with Splunk or ELK

To integrate API Analytics with Splunk or ELK:

. <<Configure the API Gateway>>.
. <<Configure API Analytics to Connect with Splunk or ELK>>.

[WARNING]
If you configure the API gateway `wrapper.conf` (Step 1) but don't assign an external destination for your data (Step 2), the analytics data accumulates in a queue in the API gateway server, which could cause the system to crash.


=== Configure the API Gateway

To set up the connection to external analytics tools, configure the API gateway:

. In your API gateway standalone directory, open the `conf/wrapper.conf` file.
+
The `.<n>` value in the code snippets refers to an integer that is unique within `wrapper.conf`.
. Ensure that the following property is set to `true` and that the line is uncommented:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_enabled=true
----

. Remove the URL from the following line:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri=https://analytics-ingest.anypoint.mulesoft.com
----
+
The line now looks like the following:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri=
----
. For Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, change the `anypoint.platform.on_prem` parameter to `true`:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.on_prem=true
----
+
If you are using the Runtime Manager cloud console, leave this parameter set to the default value, `false`. 


==== Configure Multiple Consumers 

For Mule versions 4.2.0 and 3.9.3 and later, you can forward events to both an external tool and Anypoint Platform.

To configure multiple consumers, add the following line to the `wrapper.conf` file:

[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_multiple_consumers_enabled=true
----


=== Configure API Analytics to Connect with Splunk or ELK


After you configure your API gateway, configure Splunk or ELK in Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Click the *Type* column to display the details pane for the server you want to configure.
. Click *Manage Server*.
. Click the *Plugins* tab:
+
.The arrow shows the *API Analytics* options on the server *Plugins* tab.
image::hybrid-export-api-analytics.png[API Analytics options on the server Plugins tab.]


. Under *API Analytics*, enable *ELK* or *Splunk*.

. Click the gear icon and continue with Step 8 in the following sections to complete the configuration:
+
* <<Configure Splunk Integration in Runtime Manager>>
* <<Configure the Log File for Your ELK Stack>>
