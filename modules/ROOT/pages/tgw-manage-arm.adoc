Use Anypoint Runtime Manager to manage transit gateway attachments.

== Rename a Transit Gateway Attachment

You might want to rename a transit gateway attachment to match the attachment name in AWS. 

To rename a transit gateway attachment:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, click the Transit Gateway menu (*...*) and select *Edit name*:
+

. In the popup window, enter a new name and click *Save*.

== Add a Route to the Transit Gateway Route Table

. In Anypoint Platform, on the *Transit Gateways* page, in the *VPCs* section, click *Add Route*. 
. In the *Add VPC Route* window, use CIDR notation to enter a single subnet for your
AWS VPC:
+

. Click *Add Route*.
+
Anypoint Platform submits the new route to AWS.

When the route addition succeeds, the *Transit Gateways* page shows the *Route added* message
and the *Transit Gateways* page shows the route CIDR in the route table.

In the route table, added routes show *Transit Gateway* as the value in the *Next Hop* column:

== Remove a Route from the Transit Gateway Route Table

You might need to remove a route if you no longer want a subnet to be accessible through the transit gateway.

To remove a route:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, in the *VPCs* section, click the *X* icon in the appropriate Transit Gateway route row of the route table:
+

. At the confirmation prompt, click *Remove*.

== Detach an Anypoint VPC from the Transit Gateway

You might need to detach a VPC so that you can reattach it.

Detaching a VPC from a transit gateway also deletes the attachment in AWS.
Any apps deployed to the VPC continue to run, but they are no longer connected to your Amazon VPCs and VPNs.

To detach a VPC from the transit gateway:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, click the VPC menu (*...*) and select *Detach*:
+
image::tgw-detach-vpc.png[Detach VPC option in the VPC menu]
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Detach*.
+
Detaching a VPC might take several minutes.

== Remove an Anypoint VPC from the Transit Gateway

If you reject an attachment in AWS, the VPC attachment appears as `rejected` in Anypoint Platform. 
In this case, you must remove the attachment before trying to attach it again.

To remove a VPC from the transit gateway:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, click the VPC menu (*...*) and select *Remove*:
+
// image::tgw-remove-vpc.png[Remove VPC option in the VPC menu]
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Remove*.
+
Removing a VPC might take several minutes.
+
After the VPC is removed, the *Attach VPC* button becomes available. 

== Remove a Transit Gateway from Anypoint Platform

You might need to remove a transit gateway if you've reached your entitlement limit or you want to switch the connection to a new transit gateway.

If a transit gateway has no VPCs attached, you can remove it from Anypoint Platform. 

[NOTE]
Removing a transit gateway deletes the resource share in AWS that Anypoint Platform uses to access the transit gateway.

To remove a transit gateway from Anypoint Platform:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, click the Transit Gateway menu (*...*) and select *Remove*:
+
image::tgw-remove.png[Remove option in the Transit Gateway menu]
+
Anypoint Platform prevents you from removing a transit gateway if it has VPCs attached.
+
If the *Transit Gateways* page doesn't list any VPCs, but you can't delete the transit gateway, the transit gateway might be attached to a VPC that belongs to another business group that you don't have access to.
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Remove*.
