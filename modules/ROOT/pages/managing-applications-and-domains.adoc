You can manage (deploy and list) Mule applications and domains using the Runtime Manager agent API.

To use these operations with hybrid deployments, see xref:rtm-agent-config-yaml.adoc#enable-both-rest-agent-transport-and-websocket-transport[Enable Both REST Agent Transport and WebSocket Transport].


== Manage Applications

=== Operation: List Applications

This operation lists all of the applications running on the Mule instance.

*Request:*

----
GET <host:port>/mule/applications/ HTTP/1.1
----

*Example:*

----
GET localhost:9999/mule/applications/ HTTP/1.1
----

*Response:*
[source,json,linenums]
----
[
  {
    name: 'domain1', domain: 'domain1', state: 'CREATED'
  },
  {
    name: 'domain2', domain: 'domain2', state: 'STARTED'
  }
]
----

==== Application States

The application state returned by the API, such as `CREATED` or `STARTED` in the example above, displays the status of the application depending on the Mule context phase currently being executed. Valid application states are listed below.

* `CREATED`
* `INITIALISED`
* `STARTED`
* `STOPPED`
