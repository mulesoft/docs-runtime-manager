After you xref:servers-create.adoc[add a server] and xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[deploy an application] to it, you can use the Runtime Manager to monitor and manage your application.

Depending on if your application is deployed to xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] or to xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[your own servers], there is a different set of possible actions you can perform on it, once deployed. This page focuses on the actions that are specific to applications deployed to your own servers. To view the basic management tools that are common to both types of deployment targets, see xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc[Manage Deployed Applications].

With applications deployed to your own servers, you can:

* xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitor applications] and the servers they run on
* xref:managing-servers.adoc[Manage servers]

[NOTE]
This doc covers deployments on-premises that are deployed both through the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[cloud based] or the Private Cloud Edition of the Anypoint Platform. Some of the features described in this page are not yet available on the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Options] for a clear distinction. If you’re interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, please contact your sales representative.

[NOTE]
Only the applications deployed through Runtime Manager will be visible and manageable for that tool. If you have applications manually deployed in your on-premise servers, these are not visible in Runtime Manager as the applications are not auto discovered.

== Applications Dashboard

If you select any of the applications on the Applications tab, a panel opens on the right. Here you will be able to read additional information about the application and access its settings.

image::managing-applications-on-your-own-servers-26ef4.png[]

What this dashboard displays depends on if your application is deployed on xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] or on Mule.

Applications deployed to Mule show you the status, the time of the last modification and the deployed application ZIP file – which you can change from this menu through the *Choose File* button. Applications deployed on clusters and server groups additionally display the list of servers and the status of each.

[TIP]
You can verify info about the servers the application runs on by clicking on the server name in the panel, or by searching for it in the *Servers* tab. See more on xref:managing-servers.adoc#servers-dashboard[Servers Dashboard].


On all panels, two buttons are displayed:

* The *Manage Server* button, which takes you to the application settings page. This page displays more detailed information about your app and the server it runs on. From here you can also access the apps dashboard, see xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc#the-dashboard-for-apps-on-servers[Monitoring Dashboards] for more on this.

* The *Insight* button, to see data at a transaction level. See xref:insight.adoc[Insight] for more info about what you can see here.

[NOTE]
The *Insight* feature isn't currently available on the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

== Access App Settings

Sign in to the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] and view the *Applications* tab of the Runtime Manager. Select one of your CloudHub running applications to open a panel on the right side. On that panel, click the *Manage Application* button to open up the application's settings.

In this menu you will be able to view all of the same data that's available on the panel, with the addition of an *Alerts History* tab, that displays a record of the triggered alerts on this app. See xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts on Runtime Manager] for more on this.


== Flow Management

You can individually start and stop the specific flows within your deployed applications via this tab in the UI. See xref:flow-management.adoc[Flow Management].

== Monitor Applications

If your application is deployed to one of your own servers a set of tools exists for monitoring events that may occur on your application and the performance of the servers, server groups or clusters it's running on. See xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications] for more details.


== Delete Applications

To delete a deployed application from a server, simply click on the arrow next to its status, and select *Delete*.

[NOTE]
Note that the server must be running for this option to be available. In case of a Cluster or Server Group, at least one of its nodes must be running.

== Download an Application Archive

Runtime Manager doesn't support downloading the application archive (ZIP or JAR file) from the application *Settings* page for an application deployed to an on-premises server.
However, you can download the archive using an ARM REST Services API call or the Anypoint command-line interface.

For information, see https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-to-Download-an-Archive-of-an-Application-Deployed-in-Hybrid-On-Premise-from-Anypoint-Platform-using-API-and-CLI[How to Download an Archive of an Application Deployed in Hybrid from Anypoint Platform using API and CLI].
