== Deploy an Application from Studio

You can deploy your applications directly from Studio to CloudHub.
This option is helpful if you want to test your application while developing it.

[NOTE]
--
You can deploy an application from Studio to any environment except *Design*.
The *Design* environment is specific to applications created in Anypoint Design Center.
See xref:design-center::promote-app-prod-env-design-center.adoc[Deploy a Mule Application from Flow Designer].
--

To deploy from Studio to CloudHub:

. Open your application in Studio.
. In *Package Explorer*, right-click the project folder and select *Anypoint Platform > Deploy to CloudHub*.
. If this is your first time deploying from Studio, provide your Anypoint Platform credentials at the prompt.
+
Studio stores your credentials for future use.
You can manage these credentials by selecting *Anypoint Studio > Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Authentication*.
+
After you sign in, you see the *Deploying Application* page:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Application Name* field, (*2*) the *Deploy Application* button on the *Deploying Application* page.
image::cloudhub-deploy-app-studio.png[Application Name field and the Deploy Application button]
. Change the application name, if necessary.
. Click tabs to configure application options.
+
See <<configure-application-settings,Configure Application Settings>>.
. Click *Deploy Application*.



== Deploy an Application from the Command Line

To deploy a Mule app from the CloudHub command-line interface (CLI):

. If you do not already have access to the Anypoint command-line tool, install it.
+
See xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc[Anypoint Platform CLI].
. Log into your Anypoint Platform account from the command line:
+
--
.. Enter your username:
+
`anypoint-cli --username="user"`
.. At the prompt, enter your password.
--
. Run the following command, replacing `myMuleApp` with the deployment name of your app and `/Users/exported-app-folder/my-mule-app.jar` with the path to the deployable archive (JAR or ZIP) file on your file system:
+
----
runtime-mgr cloudhub-application deploy myMuleApp /Users/exported-app-folder/my-mule-app.zip
----
+
The command-line utility displays a table of deployment information:
+
----

----
+
After you deploy the app on CloudHub, you can view and manage it on Runtime Manager.
. If you want to stop the app from the command line, run the following command, replacing `app-name` with the deployment name of your app:
+
`runtime-mgr cloudhub-application stop app-name`

To exit the command-line tool, press Ctrl+c twice.

For a complete list of the commands, see xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc[Anypoint Platform CLI].




== Copy an Application from Sandbox to Production

If you create and test an application in a sandbox environment, you must move it to the
production environment before deploying it.
You must have the CloudHub Admin role to move applications between environments.

To avoid name conflicts, rename the application before you deploy it to another environment.

Runtime Manager prevents you from duplicating applications in a single environment,
so you cannot move an application into the environment it's already in.
If you want to duplicate an application in a single environment, rename the filename of one application
before you deploy it.

To move an application from sandbox to production:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform.
. Select *Runtime Manager* and switch to your production environment.
+
See xref:runtime-manager-switch-env.adoc##switch-environments-using-runtime-manager[Switch Environments Using Runtime Manager].
. In the *Applications* page, click *Deploy application*.
+
You see the *Deploy Application* page:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Application Name* field, (*2*) the *Get from sandbox* button, and (*3*) the *Deploy Application* button on the *Deploy Application* page.
image::cloudhub-deploy-app-sandbox.png[Application Name field and Get from sandbox and Deploy Application buttons]
. Provide a unique name for your application in production and click *Get from sandbox*.
+
This button is unavailable if no nonproduction environment exists.
. Select your sandbox environment and then the application that you want to move to production.
+
Only applications that are deployed to CloudHub appear in the list because you can move only apps
that are currently deployed to CloudHub to other CloudHub workers.
For example, you can't move an app that is currently deployed on a local server to CloudHub.
. If you want to copy the environment variables and Mule version from the source application, select *Merge environment variables and mule version*.
+
If your source application contains safely hidden application properties, you must redefine them in the *Properties* tab.
//HIDDEN PROPS XREF
include::partial$hidden-props.adoc[tag=hidePropsXref]
. Click *Apply*.
. Click tabs to configure application options.
+
See <<configure-application-settings,Configure Application Settings>>.
. Click *Deploy Application*.

== Application Names

The application name can contain between 3 and 42 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and dashes (-).
They cannot contain spaces or other characters.


//NO RENAME SHARED
include::partial$no-rename.adoc[tag=noRenameApp]

The application name identifies your application not only in Runtime Manager but also in the public `cloudhub.io` domain.
For example, an application named `myapplication` is accessible at `+http://myapplication.cloudhub.io+`.


To avoid domain conflicts, the application name must be globally unique across CloudHub.
For this reason, create a naming convention to ensure unique application names.
For example, you could prepend your company name and department to all application names,
such as `mycompany-mydept-myapplication`.
You can then add DNS records to hide the complex application name.
For example, you might route requests to `myapplication.mycompany.com` to `mycompany-mydept-myapplication.cloudhub.io`.

Using the CloudHub dedicated load balancer, you can also implement mapping rules to set your application's public URL to any other path, as long as you own the domain.
See xref:lb-mapping-rules.adoc[Mapping Rules].

== Configure Application Settings

You can configure the application deployment by clicking the tabs on the *Deploy Application* page:

.The arrow shows the configuration tabs on the *Deploy Application* page.
image::cloudhub-deploy-app-config-tabs.png[Configuration tabs on the Deploy Application page]


* <<Runtime Tab Settings,Runtime>>
* <<Autoscaling Tab Settings,Autoscaling>>
* <<Properties Tab Settings,Properties>>
* <<Insight Tab Settings,Insight>>
* <<Logging Tab Settings,Logging>>
* <<Static IPs Tab Settings,Static IPs>>



=== Runtime Tab Settings

The *Runtime* tab includes the following settings:

Runtime version::
The runtime version must be the same Mule version used to develop your application.
+
After you deploy the app, CloudHub automatically alerts you when updates for the selected runtime version are available.
See xref::cloudhub-app-runtime-version-updates.adoc[CloudHub Runtime Continuous Updates].

Worker size::
See <<Worker Size and vCores>>.
Workers::
When you deploy an application with more than one worker, CloudHub automatically balances any incoming traffic load across your allocated workers.
See xref:cloudhub-fabric.adoc[Clustering].

Region::
If you have global deployment enabled on your account, you can change the deployment region.
+
When you change the region, the domain is automatically updated.
+
See xref:cloudhub-networking-guide.adoc#regional-services[Regional Services].

Automatically restart application when not responding::
CloudHub automatically restarts your application when the monitoring system discovers an issue.
+
See xref:worker-monitoring.adoc[Application Monitoring and Automatic Restarts].
Persistent queues::
+
You can use persistent queues on your application to store data in an input queue to disk.
Persistent queues protect against message loss and enable you to distribute workloads across a set of workers.
+
See xref:managing-queues.adoc[Manage Queues].
+
Before you can take advantage of persistent queueing, you must set up your application to use queues.
+
See xref:cloudhub-fabric.adoc[Clustering].

Encrypt persistent queues::
If you enable persistent queues, you can optionally encrypt the data stored in the input queue on disk.
Use Object Store v2::
Object Store v2 is enabled by default in Mule 4.
In Mule 3, select this option to access Object Store v2.
+
See xref:object-store::index.adoc[Object Store V2].
Enable Monitoring and Visualizer::
Use Anypoint Monitoring and Visualizer for Mule applications running on supported versions of Mule.
+
This option appears only you if have a Titanium subscription to Anypoint Monitoring enabled for your organization.
+
See xref:monitoring::index.adoc[Anypoint Monitoring] and xref:visualizer::index.adoc[Anypoint Visualizer].


=== Autoscaling Tab Settings

Autoscaling enables you to define policies that respond to CPU or memory usage thresholds by scaling up or down the processing resources used by an application.

This tab doesn't appear by default.
See xref:autoscaling-in-cloudhub.adoc[Autoscaling in CloudHub] for information.


=== Properties Tab Settings

On the *Properties* tab, you can specify properties (key-value pairs) that the application uses during deployment and while running.

[NOTE]
When you deploy an application from a nonproduction environment (*Get from sandbox*), the new application inherits any properties defined in the original application.
You can update these properties as required on the *Properties* tab before deploying the application.

For more information about specifying properties, including hiding them in Runtime Manager,
see xref:cloudhub-manage-props.adoc[Manage Properties for Applications on CloudHub]
and xref:secure-application-properties.adoc[Safely Hide Application Properties].


=== Insight Tab Settings

You can enable the Insight analytics feature and specify metadata options on the *Insight* tab.
For information about using this tool, see xref:insight.adoc[Insight].


=== Logging Tab Settings

CloudHub stores activity logs, which you can view or download from Runtime Manager.
See xref:viewing-log-data.adoc[View Log Data].

You can configure the logging level (`DEBUG`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `INFO`) for the application on the *Logging* tab.

Alternatively, you can configure logging by modifying the `level` value in the `log4j2.xml` file.
See xref:mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc#configuring-custom-logging-settings[Configuring Custom Logging Settings] and https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[Apache Logging Services].

=== Static IPs Tab Settings

Use the *Static IPs* tab to allocate a static IP address to your application deployed in a specific region.

You can also preconfigure static IP addresses for multiple regions for disaster recovery (DR) scenarios.
If an application has static IP addresses allocated in multiple regions,
the static IP address is assigned when the application is deployed to a new region.

If your application is already running, applying the static IP address change restarts it using the newly applied static IP address.


By default, the number of static IP addresses allocated to your organization is equal
to twice the number of production vCores in your subscription and appears under the *Use Static IP* checkbox.

If you need to free some of your static IP allocations, you can release unused IP addresses from an application.
To increase your allocation of static IP addresses, contact your Customer Success Manager.
For more information about adding more static IPs, see https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-to-Request-Additional-Static-IPs-for-your-Anypoint-Organisation[How to Request Additional Static IPs for your Anypoint Organisation]



== Worker Size and vCores

On each application, workers are responsible for executing the application logic.

Worker sizes have different compute, memory, and storage capacities.

For information about worker size and vCores, see
xref:cloudhub-architecture.adoc#cloudhub-workers[CloudHub Workers].



== Change Settings of a Deployed Application

You can change most application settings after deploying an application to CloudHub.

To edit the settings of a deployed application:

. On the *Applications* tab, select the application name.
. Click the *Settings* tab.
. Make your changes and click *Apply Changes*

CloudHub redeploys the application with zero downtime.



== Deployment Progress

When CloudHub uploads your application and begins deploying it, CloudHub switches its user interface
to the *Logs* view so that you can monitor deployment progress.

The application status changes to `Deploying` to indicate the deployment is in progress.
When the deployment is complete, the application status changes to `Started` and a message
appears in the status area and in the logs to indicate that the application is successfully deployed.

[NOTE]
While you deploy an application on Mule runtime engine version 4.1.x and later, the xref:api-manager::gatekeeper.adoc#how-gatekeeper-works[Gatekeeper] mechanism works with xref:api-manager::api-auto-discovery-new-concept.adoc[API Autodiscovery] to help determine the readiness of a deployment.
If Gatekeeper considers the application not ready within five minutes of deployment initiation,
the application status is `Deploy failed`.

== Deployment Failure

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status
changes to `Deploy failed`.
The *Logs* tab includes details on the application deployment errors.
