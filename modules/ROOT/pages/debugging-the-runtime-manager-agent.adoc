Connection issues between your on-premises Mule runtime engine and the Runtime Manager agent might cause discrepancies, such as metrics not appearing in the server monitoring dashboard in Runtime Manager.

== Troubleshoot Connection Issues Between the Agent and Mule

To troubleshoot connection issues:

. Check the JVM you are using.
+
If you are using the IBM JVM, you must install the truststore manually because this truststore requires different parameters than Oracle JVM or OpenJDK.
+
See xref:servers-create.adoc#ibm-jvm[IBM JVM].
. Ensure you are using the latest agent version.
+
.. Check the agent version.
+
In the Runtime Manager navigation menu, select *Servers* and then click the server name.
The agent version appears on the *Dashboard* page:
+
.The arrow shows the Runtime Manager agent version on the server *Dashboard* page.

.. Check the xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes] to determine the latest agent version compatible with your Mule version.
.. Update the agent, if necessary.
+
See xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc#update-the-agent[Update the Agent].
. Verify that the license and certificate are not expired.
+
.. In the Runtime Manager navigation menu, select *Servers* and then click the server name.
The expiration dates appear on the *Dashboard* page:
+
.The arrow shows the expiration dates on the server *Dashboard* page.

+
* If the license has expired, see xref:mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Install an Enterprise License].
* If the certificate has expired, see xref:servers-cert-renewal.adoc[Renew Server Certificates].
. Verify connectivity with all required hosts.
.. Ensure that your allowlist includes the required hostnames.
+
See xref:rtm-agent-whitelists.adoc[Ports, IP Addresses, and Hostnames to Whitelist].
.. Verify that your firewall or proxy server is not intercepting the Runtime Manager certificate.
+ 
See xref:rtm-agent-proxy-config,adoc#verify-that-the-proxy-server-does-not-modify-the-runtime-manager-certificate[Verify That the Proxy Server Does Not Modify the Runtime Manager Certificate].
. Verify that the `mule-agent.yml` file is not corrupted or empty.
+
If the `<MULE_HOME>/conf/mule-agent.yml` file is empty or contains unknown characters:
+

* If you have a backup, use it to restore the corrupted `mule-agent.yml` file.
* If you don't have a backup, follow these steps:
+
.. Remove the Mule server from Runtime Manager.
+
See xref:servers-actions.adoc[Shut Down, Restart, or Delete Servers].
.. Uninstall the agent. 
+
See xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc#uninstall-the-agent[Uninstall the Agent].
.. Update the agent to the latest supported version.
+
See the xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes] and xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc#update-the-agent[Update the Agent].
.. Add the Mule server to Runtime Manager.
+
See xref:servers-create.adoc[Add Servers to Runtime Manager].


== Collect Agent Installation Information for Support 

You can use the `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_debug` script to collect information used by Support to troubleshoot the Anypoint Runtime Manager agent installation issues.
If you can't solve problems with the Runtime Manager agent, run the script and save the output before filing a support ticket.

The `amc_debug` script performs the following actions:

. Discovers the Mule agent JVM process
. Extracts the thread dump (not forced if possible)
. Optionally extracts the heap dump (if you specify the `-heap` option)
+
This step can cause delays in running applications.
+
. Extracts the Java version, CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage
. Copies all logs
. Copies the configuration files for the Runtime Manager agent
. Archives all the information collected in a ZIP file

=== Run the amc_debug Script

To run the `amc_debug` script to collect information about the agent installation:

. Open a terminal window and change to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` folder.
. Run the script:
+
`./amc_debug`
+
Include the `-heap` option to extract the heap in addition to the other data.
+
After the script finishes, the folder `$MULE_HOME/bin` contains a ZIP file with a name similar to `snapshot_202103161626.zip`.
. Send the ZIP file to Support.
