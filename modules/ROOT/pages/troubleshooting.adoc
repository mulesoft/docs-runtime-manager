If you experience problems with your deployed apps, Runtime Manager provides several tools that can help you determine the cause.

The troubleshooting resources available to you depend on your deployment strategy.

== Troubleshoot Applications

You can access information to help you troubleshoot applications using the following tools:

* xref:insight.adoc[Insight]
image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#cloudhub-deployments", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#hybrid-deployments", title="Hybrid"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-platform-pce-deployments", title="Anypoint Platform PCE"]
image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-runtime-fabric-deployments", title="Runtime Fabric"]
+
You can access a dashboard with key metrics and see events at an individual transaction level of detail.


* xref:api-functional-monitoring::index.adoc[API Functional Monitoring]
image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#cloudhub-deployments", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#hybrid-deployments", title="Hybrid"]
image:logo-server-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-platform-pce-deployments", title="Anypoint Platform PCE"]
image:logo-rtf-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-runtime-fabric-deployments", title="Runtime Fabric"]
+
Using API functional monitoring, you can automate testing and generate reports to verify API functionality and validate the results that the API generates. You can monitor APIs at each stage of the software development life cycle and in production.


* xref:viewing-log-data.adoc[View application log data]
image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#cloudhub-deployments", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#hybrid-deployments", title="Hybrid"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-platform-pce-deployments", title="Anypoint Platform PCE"]
image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-runtime-fabric-deployments", title="Runtime Fabric"]
+
You can access a log of events occurring to your application and the CloudHub workers they run on.
+
For applications deployed to your own servers, you can export log data to third-party software to view there.

== Troubleshoot Servers

image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-runtime-fabric-deployments", title="Runtime Fabric"]

With applications deployed to your own servers, you can access information to help you troubleshoot them through the following tools:

* xref:monitoring.adoc#monitoring-servers[Monitor servers]
+
Use alerts and dashboards to get information about the servers.
* xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[Export data to external analytics tools]
+
Send data to an external tool like Splunk or ELK.
