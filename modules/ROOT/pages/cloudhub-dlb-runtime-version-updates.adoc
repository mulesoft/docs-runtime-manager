Because CloudHub is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS),
it manages the underlying operating sistem of your DLBs,
enabling you to focus on developing and updating your applications.

CloudHub applies security patches as needed to ensure that your dedicated load balancer is secure and,
every 14 days, it updates the image of the operating system to maintain the stability of your DLB.

Patch updates use blue-green deployment, which ensures zero downtime.


CloudHub applies continuous updates to all three MuleSoft-managed deployment platforms:

* US cloud
* EU cloud
* MuleSoft Government Cloud

== Security Updates

MuleSoft regularly runs scans to identify security vulnerabilities in underlying operating system, and then automatically applies security patches based on the following SLA:

[%header,cols="20,25,40"]
|===
|Severity Level | Severity Definition | Patch Applied Within
|P0 | Critical | 7 days
|P1 | High | 30 days
|===


== Updates every 14 days

Every 14 days, MuleSoft releases a _date-patch update_,
which includes bug fixes to address any security vulnerability discovered in operating sistem of the dedicated load balancers.


=== Update Schedule

The schedule for date-patch updates is:

* On the first day of the update, MuleSoft releases the date patch.
* In the second full week of the update, MuleSoft automatically applies the date patch that was released.
+
The update will be applied between the 10th and 12th day of the update to all Sandbox DLBs.
Lastly, the update will be applied between the 13th and 14th day of the update to all Production DLBs.

[NOTE]
A DLB will be considered as a Production DLB if it is part of a VPC that is default or if the VPC is associated with at least one production environment.

Because these updates contain required security patches, you cannot roll back these updates once applied.

=== Updating Dedicated Load Balancers manually

For information about updating DLBs, see
xref:lb-updates.adoc[Dedicated Load Balancer Updates].

== Zero-Downtime Considerations

The update results in a rolling restart with no downtime. However, some inflight requests might be impacted.

If you experience a sustained outage after updating, contact MuleSoft Support.
