== What is CloudHub?

CloudHub is a cloud-based integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that enables developers to integrate and orchestrate applications and services while giving operations the control and visibility they require for mission-critical demands, all without the need to install or manage middleware or hardware infrastructure. You can deploy applications to CloudHub through Anypoint Runtime Manager, found on https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform]. Read more about the CloudHub xref:cloudhub-architecture.adoc[architecture].


== What is iPaaS?

As the name suggests, iPaaS (integration platform as a service) is a development platform for building integration applications. It provides a set of services and capabilities for integrating applications in the cloud and within the enterprise. The core tenets of iPaaS are the same as PaaS, except the services on the platform are geared towards integration. In addition to some base expectations, such as multi-tenancy, elasticity and reliability, iPaaS also provides intermediation of data and events, orchestration, a service container for publishing REST and SOAP services, strong security capabilities, and monitoring and developer tooling.

For more information, see https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/mule-dev/introducing-integration-paas-ipaas/[Introducing integration PaaS (iPaaS)].


== How can I create a CloudHub account?

As of November 2014, accounts in both CloudHub and Anypoint Platform for APIs have been merged into a single platform.

An https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signup[Anypoint Platform account] gives you access to both the *Runtime Manager* – for deploying and managing applications both on *CloudHub* and on other servers –  and to the Anypoint Platform for APIs – for creating and managing APIs through their entire lifecycle.

* xref:access-management::managing-your-account.adoc[Creating an Account]
* xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[Managing Accounts Roles and Permissions]

== Where can I get Anypoint Studio?

Anypoint Studio can be downloaded https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio[here]. From Studio, you can deploy directly to CloudHub or run your applications locally on an embedded Mule runtime engine (Mule).

== What happens when my subscription expires?

Seven days before your Anypoint Platform account subscription expires, you receive an email notifying you that your account is about to expire and prompting you to contact your account representative to retain your account.

When your subscription expires, you can't restart existing apps or create new apps. Running apps might stop without notice at the discretion of MuleSoft.

To renew your subscription, contact your account representative.


== What is a worker?

Applications that expose real-time services or APIs run on one or more "workers." Each worker is an instance of Mule that runs your integration applications. See xref:cloudhub-fabric.adoc[Clustering] for details of how workers can be shared or doubled to scale your application and provide high availability.

== What is an integration application?

An integration application is one that integrates two or more applications or services. This might be as simple as synchronizing Salesforce data to a local database, or as complicated as creating a mashup using Google Apps, Facebook, and Salesforce. These applications perform functions by grabbing data from different sources and publishing it to a new location or as a REST or web service. In the traditional three-tier application model an integration app represents the data tier through connectivity to application data and the service tier through logic used to combine, transform, and route this data to consumers.

== What are Anypoint Connectors?

Anypoint Connectors provide an easy way to integrate with SaaS and Cloud APIs, such as Salesforce, Facebook, AWS, PayPal, and then to use them as services within Mule. With these connectors you are then able to create orchestration that spans both SaaS and on-premises applications, using Mule.

== What is a Mule flow?

A Mule flow defines how Mule processes messages between different applications. A flow defines a series of processors that act on a message triggered by an event in an application, a request to a web or REST service, or a scheduled trigger.


== What Java version are you using?

* Workers that use Mule 4.0.0 and later run on JDK 8.
* Workers that use Mule 3.8.0 and later run on JDK 8.
* Workers that use Mule 3.7.0 and later run on JDK 8.
* Workers that use Mule 3.5.1 and later run on JDK 7.
* Workers that use Mule 3.5.0 and earlier run on JDK 6.

== How much storage does each worker have?

The amount of storage each worker has depends on the worker size.
For information about worker sizes, see
xref:cloudhub-architecture.adoc#cloudhub-workers[CloudHub Workers].

== What are environment variables?

Environment variables are properties you can set to pass in configuration to your Mule application. For example, you can create a JDBC connector with a username is set to `${db.username}`. In the environment variables, you can then set the name to `db.username` and the value to the actual username when you add or update your application.

== Can I deploy my application to a different region?

Yes! Visit https://help.mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Help Center] to file a support case to enable global deployments for your account. Applications can be deployed to: US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (N. California, Oregon), Canada, South America (Brazil - Sao Paulo), Europe (Ireland, Frankfurt), UK (London), and Asia-Pacific (Sydney, Tokyo, Singapore). Administrators can  xref:managing-cloudhub-specific-settings.adoc[set the default region] on the *Organization* tab in Account Settings, but that region can be adjusted when the application is deployed, if necessary.

Note that the domains of applications deployed to different regions are automatically updated to reflect the region.

== Why do I get "Failed to bind to uri" when my application starts?

If you're seeing messages like this, it's because you're trying to bind to a specific host instead of 0.0.0.0:

[source,console]
----
INFO 11-04-06 20:13:50 [DefaultSystemExceptionStrategy] Failed to bind to uri `+http://foo.cloudhub.io:8081/+`
----

Change your HTTP Connector to use 0.0.0.0 instead of your CloudHub domain name, and redeploy.

== How do I stop my application?

In the Runtime Manager console, select your application, and click *Deployment* in the left navigation bar. Then, click *Stop application*.

== Can the platform restart my Mule app running on CloudHub?

Yes. The following scenarios can result in the platform restarting your application (all restarts are xref:cloudhub-architecture.adoc#zero-downtime-updates[zero-downtime], unless the initial state of the app was down):

* *Underlying infrastructure issues*
+
If the underlying infrastructure suffers a failure, the platform migrates your application to a new worker.
* *Infrastructure impairment*
+
Any applications running on hardware marked as impaired or end-of-life are restarted to preemptively migrate the app to a new worker to prevent a possible outage.
* *Security patching*
+
If any security vulnerabilities are identified, the relevant applications are patched and restarted. See the https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#critical[Critical Security Vulnerabilities] policy.
* *Application crash*
+
The platform recognizes an application crash (due to a problem with custom code or a bug in the underlying stack) and restarts the worker automatically if the automatic restart option is selected.

== Why can't I deploy more than one application?

MuleSoft is limiting the free accounts to one worker, which allows you to deploy one application. You can upgrade to a http://www.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/cloudhub-pricing[paid subscription] to deploy more applications, or you can scale your single application across more than one worker.

== My application has deployed successfully, so why do I see "you need to change the configuration of your docroot" when I go to mysubdomain.cloudhub.io?

If you are seeing this message, your application's endpoint might be configured to show up in a different path. If you want to make it show up at mysubdomain.cloudhub.io, reconfigure your endpoint to remove the path variable. If you are using generic endpoints, change the address (not the path).

== How long is the HTTP read timeout?

Our load balancers time out after 300 seconds if no data is read.

== Can I get a static IP for my application?

You can assign a static IP to your application by using the *Static IPs* application settings tab. For details, see xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc#static-ips-tab-settings[Static IPs Tab Settings]. By default, you are allocated a number of static IPs equal to twice the number of production vCores in your subscription. To raise this limit, contact MuleSoft Support.

== How do I know what my static IP is?

The static IPs assigned to your application are displayed in the *Static IPs* tab in the application settings page.

== Can I modify my application after it has been assigned a static IP?

Yes, you can stop and start the application, upload a new project zip file, change its settings, and redeploy it.

== In what situations could my static IP change?

Your static IP might be removed or reassigned in a couple of specific situations:

* Deleting an application also removes its static IP. If you create a new application with the same name, it has a new dynamically assigned IP address.
* Adding a new application by moving it from Sandbox to Production
This requires a new application name and a new static IP.
* If xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC)] is built for your organization, any existing application that is not already in Anypoint VPC receives a new IP address when it restarts inside Anypoint VPC.
* An application is redeployed to a different geographic region.
+
You can preallocate a static IP in the new region in the *Static IPs* tab in the application settings page.

== Can I request a specific static IP address?

No. CloudHub uses a pool of static IP addresses that are assigned to a CloudHub application only upon first deployment. If that application releases that static IP, then that IP address returns to the pool and is available to other applications.

== If I am running in a CloudHub VPN, how do I assign a static IP to my internal private IP?

CloudHub can set the worker's public IP address to be static. However, the internal private IP address always remains dynamic. The private IP address is assigned from the range specified in the CloudHub worker's address space, which was determined when your xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Anypoint VPC] was created.

== What are the possible IP ranges that can be assigned to static IP addresses?

Because CloudHub deploys on Amazon EC2, IP addresses are chosen from the Amazon EC2 IP pool. For a list of these ranges, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html[Amazon EC2 Public IP Ranges].

== How can I change the timezone for my app?

Customers with an Enterprise account can choose any global region in which to deploy their app. The actual worker is always running in the UTC timezone.


== Proactive Monitoring

The CloudHub platform is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by automated systems. Should any issue affect the health of the CloudHub infrastructure, the operations team is notified and responds immediately to diagnose and correct it. This 24x7 monitoring covers the entire CloudHub platform, benefiting all CloudHub users. You can view the current status of CloudHub services and upcoming maintenance at http://status.mulesoft.com[`status.mulesoft.com`] and http://eu1-status.mulesoft.com[`eu1-status.mulesoft.com`].
