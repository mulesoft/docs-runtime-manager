The Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) offering allows you to create a virtual, private, and isolated network segment in the cloud to host your CloudHub workers.

Connecting to your Anypoint VPC extends your corporate network and allows CloudHub workers to access resources behind your corporate firewall. You can connect on-premises data centers through a secured VPN tunnel, or a private AWS VPC through VPC peering, or by using AWS Direct Connect.

The base Anypoint VPC subscription includes two Anypoint VPCs and each Anypoint VPC can be associated with multiple environments. This allows you, for example, to have one isolated network for your production environment, and another for your non-productions environments, for example, QA and staging. Your licensing requirements depend on your specific deployment scenario. 

Anypoint VPC supports different Amazon regions. During setup, you need to specify which Amazon region you want. You can even have multiple Anypoint VPCs inside a single Amazon region.

Each Anypoint VPC allows you to configure firewall rules to apply to your workers. You can choose to expose or block your custom ports and even block requests to your apps coming from CloudHub's shared load balancer. 

If you use dedicated load balancers, you can configure one or more dedicated load balancers to validate requests using your own SSL certificates, and to map input URLs to call to different CloudHub applications. 

Combining firewall rules and dedicated load balancers configurations, enables you to fine tune how external services reach your applications.
