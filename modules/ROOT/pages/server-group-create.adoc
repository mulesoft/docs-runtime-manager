To deploy applications to a server group, you can either add the servers to Runtime Manager first and then create the server group, or you can create the group and add servers to it later.

To create a server group:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Select *Servers* in the left menu.
. Click the *Create Group* button.
. In the *Create Server Group* page, enter the name for the server group.
+
Group names can contain between 3-40 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-). They cannot start or end with a hyphen and cannot contain spaces or other characters.
. Select the servers to include in your new server group.
. Click the *Create Group* button.

The new server group appears in the *Servers* list. The servers no longer appear in the *Servers* list. To see the list of servers in the group, click the server group name.
