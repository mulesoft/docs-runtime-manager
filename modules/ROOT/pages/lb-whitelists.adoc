In order to whitelist IP addresses to your load balancers, pass those IP addresses in CIDR notation using the xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc#cloudhub-load-balancer-whitelist-add[`load-balancer whitelist add`] command.

The whitelist works for inbound connections at the load balancer level, not at the CN certificate level. Make sure you only pass IP addresses.
