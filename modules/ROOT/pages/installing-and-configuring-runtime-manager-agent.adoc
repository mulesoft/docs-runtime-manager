The Runtime Manager Agent is installed into a Mule runtime engine, and is used to register the Mule with Runtime Manager. The Mule runtime engine is then registered and controlled by Runtime Manager within a specific environment of a specific Anypoint Platform business group.

The latest version of the Mule runtime engine is bundled with the latest version of the Runtime Manager Agent. You can download the latest Mule runtime engine from the https://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[Customer Portal].

[NOTE]
You must download and install the version of the Runtime Manager Agent that supports the version of Anypoint Platform you are using. The version of Runtime Manager Agent you need may be different from the version bundled with the current version of Runtime Manager. You may need to downgrade the version of the agent to support your version of the platform.

If you use an earlier version of the Mule runtime engine, or an earlier API Gateway Runtime, or if a later version of the Runtime Manager Agent releases in between Mule runtime engine releases, then you can download and install the latest version of the Runtime Manager Agent from the
https://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[Customer Portal].


[NOTE]
====
For the latest version of the Runtime Manager Agent, see the xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Mule 3.7.x and API Gateway 2.x provide an xref:runtime-manager-agent.adoc[earlier version of the Runtime Manager Agent]. This earlier version doesn't provide support for xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[Sending data from Runtime Manager to External Analytics Software]. If you are running these earlier versions, you may need to upgrade the Runtime Manager Agent software.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you're deploying your applications to a xref:deploying-to-pcf.adoc[Pivotal Cloud Foundry] environment, then you don't need to worry about installing or configuring the Runtime Manager Agent. In that scenario, the agent functions as usual as the link between the Mule and the Runtime Manager. However, the same PCF build pack that automatically creates new runtime instances also creates agent instances and registers these to the Runtime Manager. If you want to change the configuration of your agent instances, you must modify the build pack.
====

== Prerequisites

The Runtime Manager Agent is bundled with the Mule and API Gateway software distributions; however, you may need to download and use the new ZIP version to update your Runtime Manager Agent to the latest version.

This document assumes that your enterprise license is current. See xref:3.8@mule-runtime::installing-an-enterprise-license.adoc[Installing an Enterprise License] for information on obtaining and installing an enterprise license.

The Runtime Manager Agent works with Mule 3.6.0 and later, and API Gateway 2.1 and later.

[TIP]
====
We recommend that you run the latest version of Mule Enterprise. You can download the latest version from the http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[customer portal].
====

== Install from a Software Distribution

The agent comes bundled with your Mule runtime engine installation. You can install it by running `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_setup` (or `$MULE_HOME\bin\amc_setup.bat` if on Windows).

*See the <<Installation Options>> section below for the arguments that can be used when running this command.*

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, Mule 3.7.x and earlier, and API Gateway 2.x and earlier provide an xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[earlier version of the Runtime Manager Agent]. This version doesn't provide support for xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[Sending data from Runtime Manager to External Analytics Software]. Later versions that do provide support for this must be downloaded separately.

*Mule 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 Installation:*

Download the agent and follow the steps in the <<Installing the Agent from the Zip File,Installing the Agent from the Zip File>> section. Then depending on your OS, run `amc_setup` or `amc_setup.bat`.
====

== Download the Latest Version of the Agent


You can find the latest version of the Runtime Manager Agent available by checking the
xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent release notes] page.

Earlier versions of the Release Notes have download links to earlier versions of Runtime Manager Agent.

== Installing the Agent from the ZIP File

. Stop Mule or the API Gateway runtime. +
You can stop Mule with the `./mule stop` command or by killing the process.
. Expand the `mule-agent-[VERSION].zip` file to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` Mule software distribution folder.
. When prompted, replace (overwrite) any conflicting files (`amc_setup` and `amc_setup.bat`).
+
[TIP]
====
The agent ZIP file contains these three files.

* `amc_setup` - Mac and Linux installation file
* `amc_setup.bat` - Windows installation file
* `agent-setup-<version>.jar` - Called by the installation files
====
+
. Depending on your OS, run `amc_setup` or `amc_setup.bat` on the command line to install or update the Runtime Manager Agent plugin.


*See the <<Installation Options>> section below for the arguments that can be used when running this command.*

The installed Runtime Manager Agent works correctly with Mule and API Gateway runtime versions that already include the Runtime Manager Agent in the distribution.

After downloading the Runtime Manager Agent ZIP file, determine if you can update an existing Runtime Manager Agent installation. Check on the corresponding xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].

== Update an Earlier Runtime Manager Agent Installation

You can update an earlier existing Runtime Manager Agent installation. To see how to install a new Runtime Manager Agent, see the <<Installation Options>> section below.

[TIP]
====
If you're not sure if an earlier version of Runtime Manager Agent is already installed, check the `$MULE_HOME/conf` folder. If an earlier version was installed, then a `mule_agent.yml` configuration file is in the folder.
====

Previous releases of compatible Mule and API Gateway runtimes shipped with an earlier version of the `amc_setup` script. If you already ran an earlier version of this script to install Runtime Manager Agent, you can upgrade the Runtime Manager Agent software, but you should keep your existing Runtime Manager Agent configuration and modifications.

To upgrade an existing Runtime Manager Agent:

. Stop your Mule runtime engine.
. Uncompress the Runtime Manager Agent ZIP file in your `$MULE_HOME/bin` folder.
+
This may replace the `amc_debug`, `amc_setup` and `amc_setup.bat` files.
. Run `./amc_setup -U` to update the agent version.
+
This script updates the Runtime Manager Agent, but does not override the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file.
. Restart your Mule runtime engine.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Windows, run `amc_setup.bat -U` instead of `./amc_setup -U`, and restart Mule with the `$MULE_HOME/bin/./mule restart` command.

*See the <<Installation Options>> section below for the arguments you can use when running this command.*
====

[NOTE]
====
For information on starting and stopping API Gateway, see xref:1.x@api-manager::configuring-an-api-gateway.adoc[Configuring an API Gateway].
====

== Remove a Previous Installation

The installation of the Runtime Manager Agent creates two configuration files: `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.jks` and `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml`.  To uninstall the agent configuration, just remove these files and restart the instance.

=== About the Runtime Manager Agent Update Process

The `amc_setup` script makes the following changes to your Mule runtime engine installation:

. Backs up the current version of the agent:
** Everything under `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER` is archived into  `$MULE_HOME/tools/mule-agent-backup.zip`.
** Any custom modules you have installed (usually located in `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib/modules`) are archived into  `$MULE_HOME/tools/mule-agent-modules-backup.zip`.
. Updates agent libs under `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib`
. Keeps the current `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` configuration file.
. Keeps modules under `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib/modules` unchanged (all custom modules added to the agent that are not included in the agent distribution should be installed in this folder).
. No reregistration is needed after the process is done, just restart the Mule or API Gateway instance.


== Installation Options

If you are not updating a previous Runtime Manager Agent installation, or if you want to change some of the configuration options, you may need to run the `amc_setup` command with other options.

There are three different ways to install and configure a Runtime Manager Agent.

* Connect a Runtime Manager Agent with an Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager cloud-based console.
* Connect a Runtime Manager Agent with an Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Runtime Manager console.
* Connect a Runtime Manager Agent with a third party monitoring console.

Each configuration choice has a different set of options for the `amc_setup` command.

You can run `./amc_setup --help` to see the available options for the installation command.

=== Editing the Runtime Manager Agent Configuration File

Most of the Runtime Manager Agent configuration options add or replace configuration text to the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file. Often you can combine several configuration options into a single `amc_setup` command, or you can add additional configurations later by re-running the `amc_setup` command with different (non-conflicting) options. For example, you can configure a Runtime Manager Agent to communicate with both a Runtime Manager server and with a third party console.

=== Selecting and Configuring Monitoring Console Options

Normally, you configure a Runtime Manager Agent to communicate and exchange monitoring information with an Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager cloud console. This type of installation is performed using the `-H` option, along with the security token provided by the Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager cloud console. Communication with either type of Anypoint Runtime Manager console is through WebSockets, and will be configured as a WebSockets transport in the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file.

=== Combining Monitoring Console Options

You can configure a Runtime Manager Agent to communicate with other management consoles using one or more REST transports. These options are supported by the `-I` and `-S` options.

If you run `amc_setup` with the `-I` or `-S` options, your previous `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file is completely replaced. 

There are some configuration options that are not possible using the `amc_setup` command, such as extending JMX monitoring to other external services, so these options must be manually added to the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file. You can also backup various configuration options in the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file. 

=== Configure JMX Monitoring Publication Services

MuleSoft provides several OpenSource JMX monitoring publishing modules for Cloudwatch, Graphite, Nagios, and Zabbix. The Nagios module is already included in Mule runtime engine.

Cloudwatch publishers: allows users to send JMX metrics to Amazon Cloudwatch.

Graphite: provides Graphite JMX metrics integration.

Nagios: provides integration with Nagios.

Zabbix: module to send metrics to Zabbix instances.

For further information, check the JMX section in Runtime Manager Agent documentation.

== amc_setup Parameters

The `amc_setup` command has various parameters to fulfill different use cases:

* Register a Mule runtime engine with a Runtime Manager console
* Manage a Mule runtime engine via the local Runtime Manager Agent REST API interface, either via HTTP or HTTPS
* Update the Runtime Manager Agent software
* Get Help

The required arguments differ depending on if you're registering your server to manage using the cloud console of Runtime Manager, or to manage using the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

The following tables provide details about the parameters you use for these different use cases.


=== General amc_setup Parameters

These arguments work in CloudHub and Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

[%header,cols="30a,60a"]
|===
|Parameter|Description

|`--help`
|See a help listing print out to the command-line.

|`-U`

`--update`
|Update the Runtime Manager Agent software. Preserves the existing mule-agent.yml configuration.

|`-E`

`--encrypt`
|Utility to encrypt the passwords used on the mule-agent.yml file.


|`--mule-home`
|The location of the `$MULE_HOME` directory. Use this option if you are not running the installation script from `$MULE_HOME/bin`. The mule-agent.yml file is read from `../conf`, relative to this `--mule-home` location.

|`--skip-gateway-clientid`
|Skip Anypoint API Gateway client_id and client_secret configuration.
|===


=== Hybrid Runtime Manager Management

Configures the Runtime Manager Agent to create a hybrid management connection with a Runtime Manager. The connection is to a specific environment for a specific business group. The business group can exist in an account in the MuleSoft managed (cloud-based) Anypoint Platform, or in an Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition installation which you are responsible for managing.


The simplest way to manage a Mule runtime engine is to register the Mule runtime engine with the MuleSoft managed Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager console.
This option, configurable on the installation command through the '-H' argument, configures the Runtime Manager Agent to connect to the Runtime Manager. This option requires a token (provided by the Runtime Manager console) and an instance name. For details, see xref:managing-servers.adoc#add-a-server[Managing Servers].

The `-H` parameter is required to register a Mule runtime engine with Runtime Manager. You must provide a valid registration token to this parameter. The registration token is generated by the Runtime Manager console, for a specific environment within a specific business group. The Mule runtime engine will then be managed within this particular Anypoint Platform business group's environment.  The term *hybrid* indicates that the same `-H` parameter is used for both types of Runtime Manager installations: MuleSoft managed (cloud-based) Anypoint Platform accounts, and Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Editions accounts.

In the Runtime Manager console, you can see a full example of the code you need to run by clicking the xref:managing-servers.adoc#add-a-server[Add Server] button. This example command already includes the registration token with you specific organization's ID and the current environment, so it is ready to use in case you don't need to configure anything beyond the default settings.


[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Parameter|Description

|`-H <token> <server-name>`

`--hybrid <token> <server-name>`
|Configures the Runtime Manager Agent to create a hybrid management connection with a Runtime Manager. The connection is to a specific environment for a specific business group in Anypoint Platform. The same command is used for all types of Runtime Manager installations: MuleSoft managed (cloud-based) Anypoint Platform accounts, and Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Editions accounts.

`<token>` is a base64 encoded string that specifies the exact business group and environment with which to register the Mule runtime engine with the Runtime Manager. You obtain this token using the *Add Server* button in a Runtime Manager console, and the token is generated by Runtime Manager.

`<server-name>` is the instance name with which to label the Mule runtime engine in the Runtime Manager console. This name must be unique within the business group's environment.

|`-P <PROXY_HOST> <PROXY_PORT> <PROXY_USER> <PROXY_PASSWORD>`

`--proxy <PROXY_HOST> <PROXY_PORT> <PROXY_USER> <PROXY_PASSWORD>`
|Proxy configuration to use when registering with the connection. This option defines proxy details. See <<Installation Via Proxy>>.

|===

==== Obtaining a Registration Token
The `-H` parameter is required to register a Mule runtime engine with Runtime Manager. You must provide a valid registration token to this parameter. The access_token is copied from the Runtime Manager console, for a specific environment within a specific business group. The Mule runtime engine will then be managed within this particular Anypoint Platform business group's environment.  The `-H` is used for both regular (cloud-based) Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Editions.

To obtain the registration token, you need to use the *Add Server* option in the Runtime Manager. This presents a complete command to register the Mule runtime engine in the format `./amc_setup -H <token> <server-name>`. Once you have the command with the registration token, copy-paste it into the `$MULE_HOME/bin` folder for each Mule runtime engine you wish to register. Make sure to change the instance name `server-name` to the unique instance name you wish to use to label this Mule runtime engine in the Runtime Manager console.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the same copied registration command for multiple Mule runtimes, but make sure to change the default instance name `server-name` to a different and unique instance name for each Mule runtime engine.
====

Here is an example `mule-agent.yml` file generated by the `-H` option:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----

  rest.agent.transport:
    enabled: false
  websocket.transport:

----

[WARNING]
====
It is not supported to register a Mule runtime engine with multiple Runtime Manager business groups or environments.

It is also not supported to register a Mule runtime engine with both an older xref:mule-management-console::index.adoc[Mule Management Console (MMC)] and Runtime Manager. If the Mule runtime engine is currently managed in MMC, you should first unregister the Mule runtime engine with MMC before running the `amc_setup -H` script.
====

[TIP]
====
MuleSoft support can provide you with some migration scripts to help you migrate from MMC to Runtime Manager.

For details, see xref:managing-servers.adoc#add-a-server[Managing Servers].
====

=== Installation Via Proxy

If your Mule runtime engine will run inside a firewall what restricts external communication through a proxy server, you can configure the Runtime Manager Agent to route REST traffic through the proxy server to Runtime Manager.

To configure the proxy server, pass in the '-P' argument along with the -H argument.

Format: `amc_setup -H <token> <Server Name>  -P <Proxy Host> <Proxy Port> [<Proxy User> <Proxy Password>]`

Where:

* _Proxy Host_ - The host of the desired proxy. You should be able to just specify the hostname. For example you can specify `proxy.acme.com`, not the full URL `+http://proxy.acme.com+` nor `+https://proxy.acme.com+`. If you include `http://` or `https://` in the hostname, you may get an error.
* _Proxy Port_ - The port of the desired proxy.
* _Proxy User_ - (Optional) The user with which to authenticate against the proxy, if the proxy server requires authentication.
* _Proxy Password_ - (Optional) The password with which to authenticate against the proxy, if the proxy server requires authentication.

[NOTE]
====
the _Proxy User_ and _Proxy Password_ are optional and may be omitted if the proxy doesn't require authentication.
====

Here is an example of configuring the Runtime Manager Agent with a Runtime Manager token, and also configure a proxy server:


[source,console,linenums]
----
amc_setup -H <token> MaxRuntime -P acme.proxy.com 443
----

Here is an example for a proxy server that requires authentication:


[source,console,linenums]
----
amc_setup -H <token> MaxRuntime -P acme.proxy.com 443 internalAdmin Ins1d3V0icePassword
----

If you have already installed the Runtime Manager Agent and want to change its configuration to use a proxy, you can do so by editing the `mule-agent.yml` file.

In addition to configuring the proxy server in the Runtime Manager Agent, you should also configure the proxy server in the `wrapper.conf` file, to also enable API related communication and analytics. For details, see <<Setting up a Proxy>>.


==== Register with an Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Runtime Manager

With Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, all the Runtime Manager related services run on-premises rather than in a MuleSoft hosted cloud environment.

The steps to register a Mule runtime engine with an on-premises Runtime Manager are similar to how you register a Mule runtime engine with a MuleSoft managed (cloud-based) Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager, with the following additional final steps:

. Log into an Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition account.
. Ensure that you have correctly setup the DNS entry for your platform. See xref:access-management::private-cloud-edition-features.adoc#dns-or-ip[DNS or IP]
. Select a business group and environment to register the Mule runtime engine.
. Within the selected environment, select *Servers* from the left side navigation menu, then click *Add Server*.
. Copy the registration command and paste it into the `$MULE_HOME/bin` folder of the Mule runtime engine you want to register with this Runtime Manager environment. The registration command has the syntax: `./amc_setup -H <token> _server-name_`.
. Replace `_server-name_` with a name for this Mule runtime engine in the Runtime Manager console.
. Add additional parameters to specify the URL of required Anypoint Platform services.
+

The registration command has the same format `./amc_setup -H <token> _server-name_` as the MuleSoft managed Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager, but the registration token will not work in the MuleSoft managed Anypoint Platform. At this point, you need to append some additional parameters to the registration command (after the server name). These parameters specify the URLs for the various services used by Runtime Manager to manage your Mules.

[NOTE]
====
You must supply all the correct values for the registration command parameters to properly register the Mule runtime engine with the on-premises Runtime Manager. All of these parameters are used only to append the `-H` parameter. They are not used with the `-I` or `S` parameters to configure non Runtime Manager REST API connections.
====

==== Specify URLs of On-Premises Services

This table describes all the additional parameters you need to append to the `./amc_setup -H <token> <server-name>` command to register a Mule runtime engine with an Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Runtime Manager.

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]

----

=== REST Connection amc_setup Parameters

These arguments work in both versions of Anypoint Platform (cloud and on-premises), to allow direct REST connections between the Mule runtime engine and any external client. This allows external clients to access and manage a Mule runtime engine directly via the xref:runtime-manager-agent-api.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent's REST API].

You can configure the Runtime Manager Agent to allow either insecure or secure connections.

With a secure REST configuration, you need to configure the Runtime Manager Agent with a valid digital certificate. The insecure REST configuration option allows you to skip this step.

=== Insecure Connection Channel


This option, configurable on the installation command through the '-I' parameter, configures the Runtime Manager Agent to use an unencrypted connection. It is valid for the REST transport only. You can interact with the API using a browser or other tool for making HTTP requests.

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Parameter|Description

|`-I`

`--insecure`
|Configures the Runtime Manager Agent to use an unencrypted connection. It is valid for the REST transport only. You can interact with the API using a browser or other tool for making HTTP requests. The default TCP port is 9999, so you can connect to the Runtime Manager Agent at the base URL `+https://localhost:9999/mule/agent/+`.

    frequencyTimeUnit: MINUTES
----



=== Secure Connection Channel

This option, configurable on the installation command through the '-S' argument, configures the Runtime Manager Agent to establish a TLS connection with an on-premises administration console.

You need to provide the truststore and keystore in JKS format. This option enables a TLS channel for REST communications only. Once you select the Secure connection Channel mode, you see the following menu:

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Parameter|Description


|`-S`

`--secure`
|Configures the Runtime Manager Agent to establish a TLS connection with an on-premises administration console. You need to provide the truststore and keystore in JKS format. This option enables a TLS channel for REST communications only. See <<Secure Connection Channel>>. Note that this is for manually managing the Agent (i.e. not using ARM cloud-console to manage the Agent)

|===

----
The communication channel for the agent will be encrypted using
public/private key certificates. In the following steps you
will be asked to provide the keystore and truststore.
Both keystore and truststore format must be JKS.

Keystore location (?):
Truststore location (?):
Keystore Password (?):
Keystore Alias (?):
Keystore Alias Password (?):
INFO: Mule agent was successfully configured to use a TLS channel for REST communications.
----
_Keystore location_

The location of the keystore file to encrypt the communication channel. The keystore must be in JKS format. It is mandatory to provide one.

_Truststore location_

The location where of the truststore file to accept incoming requests from the administration console. The truststore must be in JKS format and must not have a password.

_Keystore Password_

The password to read the keystore. The password is used by the agent to open the keystore.

_Keystore Alias_

The alias of the key stored in the keystore.

_Keystore Alias Password_

The alias password in the keystore.

=== Configuring a Mule Runtime for 2-way TLS

Here is an example of configuring 2-way TLS with the `amc_setup -S` option.

The steps to configure TLS are:

. Generate a keystore (public/private key pair) to identify the Runtime Manager Agent (server). Set the CN to match the Runtime Manager Agent's hostname or IP Address.

+
[source,console,linenums]
----
echo "Generate a new keystore to identify the Runtime Manager Agent. Use CN=localhost"

keytool -keystore rmakeystore.jks -keypass mulesoft -storepass mulesoft  -genkey -keypass mulesoft -noprompt \
-alias rma \
-dname "CN=localhost, OU=Runtime Manager Agent, O=MuleSoft, L=San Francisco, S=Califorina, C=US"
----

. Export the Runtime Manager Agent's certificate (only the public key) to a DES formatted certificate file

+
[source,console,linenums]
----
echo "Export the rma alias' certificate from the rmakeystore.jks key store"
keytool -export -alias rma -file rma.crt -keystore rmakeystore.jks -storepass mulesoft
----



. For each REST client that will connect to the Runtime Manager Agent, generate a keystore (public/private key pair) to identify the REST client.

+
[source,console,linenums]
----
echo "Generate a new keystore to be used by client requestors. Use CN=localhost"
keytool -keystore clientkeystore.jks -storepass mulesoft -genkey -keypass mulesoft -noprompt \
-alias client \
-dname "CN=localhost, OU=RMA Client, O=MuleSoft, L=San Francisco, S=California, C=US"
----


. Export the REST client's certificate (the public key only) to a DES formatted certificate file.

+
[source,console,linenums]
----
echo "Export the client alias' certificate from the clientkeystore.jks key store"
keytool -export -alias client -file client.crt -keystore clientkeystore.jks -storepass mulesoft

. Because these are self-signed certificate files, create a truststore file containing both the client and RMA certificates (public keys). This emulates a Certificate Authority (CA) signing both of these certificates. In a more real world scenario, the server and client certificates would both be signed by a trusted CA, then published or shared with the client and server machines.

The communication channel for the agent will be encrypted using public/private key certificates.
In the following steps you are asked to provide the keystore and truststore. Both keystore and
truststore formats must be JKS.


Keystore location (?):/security/rmakeystore.jks
Keystore Password (?): mulesoft
Truststore location (?):/security/cacerts.jks
Keystore Alias (?):rma
Keystore Alias Password (?): mulesoft

----

+
You can view the `clientkeystore.pem` file to verify both the public and private keys were exported to this file.

. Submit a REST request from the client host to the Runtime Manager Agent host. Verify you do not see any SSL errors and you get a response back from the Runtime Manager Agent. Also use the `--insecure` option (or equivalently `-k`) to skip verifying the server (Runtime Manager Agent's) certificate.

== Configure the Agent

The sections that follow provide additional configuration details for Runtime Manager Agent.

[NOTE]
If you want to use the Runtime Manager Agent to send data from the Runtime Manager to Splunk, an ELK stack or other external software, then you must configure it in a different way from the one described below. See xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[Sending Data from the Runtime Manager to External Analytics Software] for details.


=== Configuring mule-agent.yml

At startup, the Runtime Manager Agent reads its configuration from the file `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml`. You must manually add, then edit this file with your installation's configuration parameters.

==== Configuration File Structure

The `mule-agent.yml` file is structured in three levels:

* First level: Component types: transports, services, internalHandlers, and externalHanders.
** Second level: Component name, for example, `mule.agent.jmx.publisher.service`.
*** Third level: Component configuration. A component can have complex object configurations, including more than one recursive level.

To learn more on how to configure the Runtime Manager Agent, refer to the documentation of each component.

==== Configuring Log Location

You can log your Runtime Manager Agent state in a separate file from the other Mule log info, to set this up, see xref:3.8@mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc#configuring-logs-for-runtime-manager-agent[Logging in Mule].

[NOTE]
This is only supported in version 1.5.2 or later of the Runtime Manager agent.

==== Configuring During Runtime

Some agent components allow you to configure them during runtime. For further information, see xref:administration-service.adoc[Administration Service].

== Enabling REST Agent Transport and WebSocket Transport

When you register a Mule runtime engine in the Runtime Manager, the generated `mule-agent.yml` disables the REST agent Transport (it replaces any existing configuration).

Conversely, if you run `./amc_setup -I`, you enable the REST agent Transport and disable the WebSocket Transport (it replaces any existing WebSocket Transport configuration used to connect to Runtime Manager).

To run both transports, modify the `mule-agent.yml` file with the following pattern:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
transports:
  websocket.transport:
    consoleUri: wss://mule-manager.anypoint.mulesoft.com:443/mule
    security:
      keyStorePassword: <password>

== Ports IPs and hostnames to Whitelist

In your network, you may need to whitelist the hostnames and ports of various parts of the Anypoint Platform to allow the Runtime Manager Agent in a customer-hosted Mule runtime engine to communicate with the MuleSoft-managed online Anypoint Platform APIs and services.

These tables show you the ports or IPs/hostnames to add to your whitelists to allow communication between the Runtime Manager Agent and the Runtime Manager console:

*Ports*

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Region |Name |Port
|*US*|*anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|*US*|*mule-manager.anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|*US*|*analytics-ingest.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |  443
|*US*|*arm-auth-proxy.prod.cloudhub.io* |  443
|*EU*|*eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|*EU*|*mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|*EU*|*analytics-ingest.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |  443
|*EU*|*arm-auth-proxy.prod-eu.cloudhub.io* |  443
|===

*Static IPs*

There are two static IPs that must be whitelisted to access the mule-manager hosts.

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Region |Name |IP Address
|*US*|*mule-manager.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |52.201.174.72
|*US*|*mule-manager.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |52.201.67.218
|*EU*|*mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |18.195.19.18
|*EU*|*mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |18.194.245.32
|===

*Dynamic IPs*

Some of the IP addresses used by Anypoint services are assigned automatically by the underlying cloud infrastructure, and hence we can't guarantee that they are not going to change in the future.

For this reason, you should not implement a whitelist based on the specific IP addresses being assigned to Anypoint services.

Nowadays, many firewall devices allow you to define Layer 7 Firewall Rules, where you could be able to filter by destination name or application type.

The hostnames that you should include in your Layer 7 Firewall rules include:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Region |Hostname
|*US*|*anypoint.mulesoft.com*
|*US*|*analytics-ingest.anypoint.mulesoft.com*
|*US*|*arm-auth-proxy.prod.cloudhub.io*
|*EU*|*eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com*
|*EU*|*analytics-ingest.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com*
|*EU*|*arm-auth-proxy.prod-eu.cloudhub.io*

== Setting up a Proxy

You can configure the Runtime Manager Agent to send websocket messages through an HTTP proxy.

The only proxy authentication method supported by the Runtime Manager Agent is Basic Authentication.

The Runtime Manager Agent reads its proxy configuration from the `wrapper.conf` file, located under Mule's `conf/` directory.

=== Default wrapper.conf File

`$MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf`.

In this file the properties that define proxy configuration are:

* `anypoint.platform.proxy_host`
* `anypoint.platform.proxy_port`
* `anypoint.platform.proxy_username`
* `anypoint.platform.proxy_password`

To send the insights and monitoring information, the Runtime Manager Agent calls the auth-proxy service. To connect to this service, the Runtime Manager Agent reads the proxy configuration from the file `mule-agent.yml`, in the `conf/` directory.

=== Agent-specific mule-agent.yml File

`$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml`.

[source,yaml,linenums]

  proxyConfiguration:
    host: "http://exampleHost"
    port: 9999
    user: "exampleUser"
    password: "examplePassword"
