Registering a Mule server in Anypoint Runtime Manager requires a valid certificate provisioned
and signed by Runtime Manager.
The certificate ensures secure communication between Runtime Manager and the Runtime Manager agent. 

When a server certificate expires, Runtime Manager displays `Disconnected` in the *Status* column 
for the server on the *Servers* page.
The `mule-agent.log` file displays a message like the following:

----
com.mulesoft.agent.transport.WSConnection: Failed attempt to connect nro. 1 to the web socket client at mule-manager.anypoint.mulesoft.com: Connection refused.
----

For applications deployed to the server, Runtime Manager displays `Unknown` in the *Status* column on the *Applications* page.

== Renew a Certificate Before it Expires 

Before a certificate expires, you can renew it directly from Runtime Manager.
The expiration date appears on the server dashboard:

.The arrow shows the *Certificate expiration date* on the *Settings* page.

You can renew a certificate for a specific server or multiple servers within a cluster or group.

The status for the server must be `Running` to update its certificate. 

To renew a certificate for a server:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Verify that the server status is `Running`.
. Click the server name.
. Click *Settings*.
. From the *Actions* menu, select *Renew Certificate*.
. Select the checkbox to confirm your choice, and then click *Renew*.
. Check *Certificate expiration date* to verify that the certificate renewed successfully.


If renewing the unexpired certificate fails, follow the steps in <<Renew a Certificate After it Expires>>.

== Renew a Certificate After it Expires 

The agent connects with Runtime Manager using mutual SSL authentication and stores the key pair 
in the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.jks` file.
The key pair is valid for two years, after which the certificate expires, and the connection with Runtime Manager terminates.

To renew the agent key pair:

. Download the `agent-certificate-renewer.jar` for your Mule version from https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Applications-and-Servers-showing-as-unknown-and-disconnected-state-in-Anypoint-Runtime-Manager-due-to-expired-key-pair[Applications and Servers showing as unknown and disconnected state in Anypoint Runtime Manager due to expired key pair].
. Move the JAR file to `$MULE_HOME/bin` and ensure that you have execute permission.
+
For example, on Linux, enter `chmod +xx agent-certificate-renewer.jar`.
. Stop Mule.
. Create a backup copy of the `$MULE_HOME/conf` directory.
. From `$MULE_HOME/bin`, run one of the following commands, depending on how you authenticate with Anypoint Platform:
+
--
** Non-federated:
+
Use your Anypoint Platform credentials on the command line:
+
`java -jar ./agent-certificate-renewer.jar -u _username_ -p _password_`
** External identity:
+
Copy the registration token for the server from *Runtime Manager > Servers > Add Server* page and include it on the command line:
+ 
`java -jar ./agent-certificate-renewer.jar -H _ServerToken_`
** Proxy connection:
+
Use your Anypoint Platform and proxy server credentials on the command line:
+
`java -jar agent-certificate-renewer.jar -u _username_ -p _password_ -P _host_ _port_ _username_ _password_`
--
+
The command displays the following messages:
+
----
INFO: Connecting to Core Services to extract authentication token. 
INFO: Connecting to Runtime Manager to request a new certificate. 
INFO: Backing up current agent keystore. 
INFO: Generating and saving new keystore.
