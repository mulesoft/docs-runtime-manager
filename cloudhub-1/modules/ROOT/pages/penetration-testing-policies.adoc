If your company security policies require that you perform vulnerability and penetration testing
against Anypoint Platform, request a Security Assessment before proceeding.


== Request a Security Assessment

To request a Security Assessment:

. Navigate to https://security.secure.force.com/securityassessments.
. If you do not already have a Salesforce account, click *Sign-in with SecureAssess*.
. Select *New User*.
. Complete the request form with the details you want to register. For further information about completing the request form, see https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000322336&type=1&mode=1[Complete the Security Assessment].
. Accept the agreement and wait for automated approval.
. If you do not receive the approval notice, check your Spam folder before contacting Salesforce.
+
After you are approved, you can log in to the portal and submit your pen test request.

[NOTE]
If you prefer, you can request approval manually by submitting your completed https://content.api.getguru.com/files/view/fbf972df-460b-4881-b84b-94d2cd3efc72[Security Assessment Request] to mailto:securityassessment@salesforce.com[securityassessment@salesforce.com].

== Run Penetration and Vulnerability Tests

Because penetration testing could interfere with other tenants, MuleSoft allows penetration testing
on your workers but not on other Anypoint Platform services.

[IMPORTANT]
Salesforce does not address any vulnerabilities found with custom development.
You must validate and fix any findings with your custom development.

=== Prerequisites

Before initiating penetration testing:

* Enable static IPs for the app.
+
By default, CloudHub workers do not use static IP addresses, so you can't test them because their IP addresses might change.
For information about how to enable static IPs, see xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc#static-ips-tab-settings[Static IPs Tab Settings].
* Assign a security resource at your company to review and validate findings from the tests.

=== Steps

After your Security Assessment request is approved, follow these steps:

. Run the penetration tests.
+
The Security Assessment Agreement includes restrictions and requirements for testing.
. Have your security resource use the following documents to identify common false positives or security issues related to settings:
+
--
** https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=Salesforce-Platform-Security-FAQs&type=1&language=en_US[Platform Security FAQ]
** https://help.salesforce.com[Salesforce Help]
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
You must complete this step before following up with Salesforce.

. Send any outstanding security vulnerability findings to mailto:security@salesforce.com[security@salesforce.com].
+
--
Include the following information in your email:

** Confirmation number for your Security Assessment approved by Salesforce
** Summary of all findings and associated severity level of each finding
** Detailed assessment report noting each finding
** Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
** All applicable HTTP requests and responses
** Explanation of why the example is considered a finding
--

=== Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

To report security vulnerability findings, follow the https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000320207&type=1&mode=1[Security Vulnerability Finding Submittal Guide]. Security vulnerability reports that do not follow the required steps will be rejected.

Salesforce does not address any security vulnerabilities in the following categories:

* Scan output from automated vulnerability scanning tools without any valid proof of concept
* Security bugs without valid proof of concept
* Vulnerabilities identified in old or deprecated versions of Mule runtime engine
* Vulnerabilities introduced via code customization made by your company
* Known security issues that do not pose any risk
