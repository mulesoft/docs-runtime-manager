Every VPN provisioned in Mulesoft has an associated risk that depends on the state of the VPN tunnels.

For high downtime risk VPNs, deploy a xref:vpn-high-availability.adoc[high-availability VPN] solution to avoid any downtime associated with AWS-delivered auto-updates. See xref:vpn-maintenance.adoc[VPN Maintenance] for more details.


== Downtime Risk types

VPN downtime risk depends on the number of UP tunnels.

There are three types of downtime risks:

* UNAVAILABLE
* LOW
* HIGH


If both tunnels of the VPN are down, the VPN downtime risk is *UNAVAILABLE*, since no data is going through the VPN.

If the VPN has one tunnel UP and the other one DOWN, then the VPN has *HIGH* downtime risk.

If the VPN has both tunnels UP, then the VPN has *LOW* downtime risk.

== Check the VPN Risk in Anypoint Platform

You can check the downtime risk associated with your VPNs in Anypoint Platform.

To check your VPN downtime risk:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform.
. Go to Runtime Manager.
. Open the *VPNs* tab.
. Check the *Downtime Risk* column for your VPN.
