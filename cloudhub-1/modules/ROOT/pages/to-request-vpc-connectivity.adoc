The process for requesting or updating Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) connectivity to your network depends on the connectivity method you use: IPsec, transit gateway attachments, VPC peering, or AWS Direct Connect.

[NOTE]
The SLA for provisioning an Anypoint VPC connection is five business days after MuleSoft Support receives and approves your completed Anypoint VPC discovery form.


== Configure IPsec VPN Connections

As of November 2018, MuleSoft Support no longer creates new VPN connections.
For all new VPNs, you must follow the self-service steps in xref:vpn-create-arm.adoc[Create an Anypoint VPN].

To update _existing_ IPsec VPN connections that were created by MuleSoft Support before November 2018:

. Download the link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/downloads/runtime-manager/VPC-form-v9.5-template.xlsx[Anypoint VPC discovery form].
+
This form requires Microsoft Excel 2007 or later (with macros enabled).
. For each VPC connection to update, complete and submit a separate Anypoint VPC form:
.. Complete all fields in the *Overview* and *IPSec* tabs.
+
To avoid processing delays, ensure that you complete all fields on both tabs.
.. Open a Support ticket and submit your completed form.

The MuleSoft Support team updates the VPN configuration using the details provided in the Anypoint VPC discovery form.
Support updates your ticket to notify you when your request is complete.

== Configure Transit Gateway Attachments

To configure transit gateway attachments, follow the self-service steps in xref:tgw-attach-arm.adoc[Attach to Transit Gateways].

== Configure VPC Peering Connections

Because MuleSoft does not support inter-region peering, both VPCs must reside in the same region.
