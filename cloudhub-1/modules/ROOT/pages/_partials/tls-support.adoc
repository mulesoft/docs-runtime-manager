// TLS 1.0 Support
//tag::tlsSupport[]
Although TLS 1.0 is not recommended due to security vulnerabilities,
you can enable support if required for communication with legacy clients.

You can enable TLS 1.0 support only on the default SSL endpoint of the DLB. 
Enabling TLS 1.0 support applies to the entire DLB, not a single SSL endpoint.

[IMPORTANT]
For security reasons, do not leave TLS 1.0 enabled.
After you no longer need TLS 1.0, replace the default cipher suite, for example, with `NewDefault`.
