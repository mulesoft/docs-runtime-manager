To deploy applications to a cluster, add the servers to Runtime Manager first and then create the cluster. You need to add at least one server to create a cluster.

For Object Store persistence on all the servers in your cluster, create your cluster manually and use Quorum Management.


== Restrictions

Before you add servers to a cluster, note the following restrictions:

* Servers cannot contain any previously deployed applications.
* Servers cannot belong to another cluster or group.
* Multicast servers can be in the *Running* or *Disconnected* state.
* Unicast servers must be in the Running state.
* All servers in a cluster must be running the same versions of:
** Mule runtime engine (including monthly update)
** Runtime Manager agent
** Java
+
For information about monthly updates, see
xref:cloudhub-app-runtime-version-updates.adoc#monthly-date-patch-updates[Monthly Date-Patch Updates].
