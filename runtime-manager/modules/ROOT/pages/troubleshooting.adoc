If you experience problems with your deployed apps, Runtime Manager provides several tools that can help you determine the cause.

The troubleshooting resources available to you depend on your deployment strategy.

== Troubleshoot Applications

You can access information to help you troubleshoot applications using the following tools:

image:logo-hybrid-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#hybrid-deployments", title="Hybrid"]
+
You can access a dashboard with key metrics and see events at an individual transaction level of detail.

image:logo-rtf-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#anypoint-runtime-fabric-deployments", title="Runtime Fabric"]

Using API functional monitoring, you can automate testing and generate reports to verify API functionality and validate the results that the API generates. You can monitor APIs at each stage of the software development life cycle and in production.


* xref:viewing-log-data.adoc[View application log data]

+
You can access a log of events occurring to your application and the CloudHub workers they run on.
+
For applications deployed to your own servers, you can export log data to third-party software to view there.

== Troubleshoot Servers
