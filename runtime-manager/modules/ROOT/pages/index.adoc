Anypoint Runtime Manager is the interface to https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform]
that provides a unified view of your applications, servers, and APIs.

With Runtime Manager, you can deploy, manage, and monitor your Mule applications in a sandbox, staging,
or production environment from one central location, whether your apps are deployed in the cloud or on-premises.

You can use Runtime Manager in these scenarios:

CloudHub::
MuleSoft hosts your app deployments in CloudHub and you use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console to manage them.
+
CloudHub is a complete integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that automatically meets all of your server needs without requiring any configuration or customization, including object store infrastructure, monitoring, troubleshooting, and scheduling.
+
For applications deployed to CloudHub, you can use Insight for analytics and monitoring.

Hybrid::
Your on-premises Mule servers host your app deployments and you use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console to manage them.
+
For applications that you deploy on-premises, you can send data to third-party analytics applications.
+
If you are using MuleSoft Government Cloud, you can deploy Mule runtime engine to a private cloud or on-premises environment and manage your app deployments using your MuleSoft Government Cloud control plane. Refer to xref:gov-cloud::gov-cloud-standalone.adoc[Standalone Mule Support] for MuleSoft Government Cloud requirements.

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition::
Your local Mule servers host your app deployments and you use the on-premises
Runtime Manager instance included with Anypoint Platform PCE to manage them.
+
If you are using the on-premises Runtime Manager, you can deploy anywhere _except_ CloudHub.
+
For applications deployed to your private cloud servers, you can send data to third-party analytics applications.

Anypoint Runtime Fabric::
Your locally hosted Runtime Fabric instance hosts your app deployments and you use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console to manage them.

[NOTE]
When you run an app in Anypoint Studio, the app deploys to an embedded test server in Studio.
Because this server is not meant for production deployment and uptime restrictions apply,
deploy your Mule app using one of the deployment options supported by Runtime Manager.
