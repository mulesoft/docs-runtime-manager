Registering a Mule server in Anypoint Runtime Manager requires a valid certificate provisioned
and signed by Runtime Manager.
The certificate ensures secure communication between Runtime Manager and the Runtime Manager agent.

When a server certificate expires, Runtime Manager displays `Disconnected` in the *Status* column
for the server on the *Servers* page.
The `mule_agent.log` file displays a message like the following:

* For Mule 3:

----
com.mulesoft.agent.transport.WSConnection: Failed attempt to connect nro. 1 to the web socket client at mule-manager.anypoint.mulesoft.com: Connection refused.
----

* For Mule 4:

----
com.mulesoft.agent.transport.WSConnection: Failed attempt to connect nro. 1 to the web socket client at runtime-manager.anypoint.mulesoft.com: Connection refused.
----

For applications deployed to the server, Runtime Manager displays `Unknown` in the *Status* column on the *Applications* page.

== View a Certificate Expiration Date

To see the expiration date for a server:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Click the server name.
+
For servers in a server group or cluster, click the server group or cluster name and then click the server name.
+
The certificate expiration date appears on the server dashboard:
+
.The arrow shows the *Certificate expiration date* on the *Dashboard* page.

== Renew a Certificate before It Expires

Before a certificate expires, you can renew it directly from Runtime Manager.

If you prefer to renew a certificate via command line, follow the steps in in <<Renew a Certificate after It Expires>>.

You can renew a certificate for a specific server or multiple servers within a cluster or group.

The status for the server must be `Running` to update its certificate.

To renew a certificate for a standalone server:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Verify that the server status is `Running`.
. Click the server name.
+
image::rtm-server-standalone-name.png[Select Server]
. Click *Settings*.
. From the *Actions* menu, select *Renew Certificate*.
+
image::rtm-server-standalone-settings.png[Settings Tab]
. Select the checkbox to confirm your choice, and then click *Renew*.
+
image::rtm-server-standalone-renew.png[Confirm Renewal]
. Check *Certificate expiration date* to verify that the certificate renewed successfully.

To renew a certificate for servers in a cluster or group:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Verify that the server status is `Running`.
. Click the group or cluster name.
+
image::rtm-server-certificate-group-name.png[Select Group or Cluster]
. Check the radio button to select the server or servers you want to update.
. From the *Actions* menu, select *Renew Certificate*.
+
image::rtm-server-certificate-group-select-server.png[Select Server]
. Select the checkbox to confirm your choice, and then click *Renew*.
+
image::rtm-server-certificate-group-renew.png[Confirm Renewal]
. Check *Certificate expiration date* to verify that the certificate renewed successfully.

If the *Renew Certificate* option in the *Actions* pull-down menu is not available after performing the previous steps, you may need to xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent#update-the-agent.adoc[update your *Agent* version].
The *Server certificate renewal* feature, which enables you to renew server certificates directly from Runtime Manager, was introduced by Runtime Manager 2.8.4. This feature requires Runtime Manager Agent 1.10.0 or later.
You can hover over the *Renew Certificate* option in the *Actions* pull-down menu, and a tooltip in the UI will indicate you the minimum required Runtime Agent version.

[NOTE]
Renewing server certificates requires a manual runtime restart to start using the new certificates.

If renewing the unexpired certificate fails, follow the steps in <<Renew a Certificate after It Expires>>.

== Renew a Certificate after It Expires

The agent connects with Runtime Manager using mutual SSL authentication and stores the key pair
in the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.jks` file.
The key pair is valid for two years, after which the certificate expires and the connection with Runtime Manager terminates.

To renew the agent key pair:

. Download the appropriate `agent-certificate-renewer-{version}.jar` file for your Mule version from https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Applications-and-Servers-showing-as-Unknown-and-Disconnected-state-in-Anypoint-Runtime-Manager-due-to-expired-key-pair[Applications and Servers Displayed as `unknown` or `disconnected` in Anypoint Runtime Manager Due to an Expired Key Pair].
. Move the JAR file to `$MULE_HOME/bin` and ensure that you have execute permission.
+
For example, on Linux, enter `chmod +xx agent-certificate-renewer-{version}.jar`.
. Stop Mule.
. Create a backup copy of the `$MULE_HOME/conf` directory.
. From `$MULE_HOME/bin`, run one of the following commands, depending on how you authenticate with Anypoint Platform:
+
--
** Nonfederated
+
Use your Anypoint Platform credentials on the command line:
+
`java -jar ./agent-certificate-renewer-{version}.jar -u <username> -p <password>`
** External identity
+
Copy the registration token for the server from the *Runtime Manager > Servers > Add Server* popup screen and include it on the command line:
+
image::rtm-server-certificate-external-identity.png[Add Registration Token]
+
And execute the following command:
+
`java -jar ./agent-certificate-renewer-{version}.jar -H <ServerToken>`
** Proxy connection
+
Use your Anypoint Platform and proxy server credentials on the command line:
+
`java -jar agent-certificate-renewer-{version}.jar -u <username> -p <password> -P <host> <port> <username> <password>`
** US GovCloud Control Plane
+
Use the following -r flag:
+
`java -jar ./agent-certificate-renewer-{version}.jar -H <ServerToken> -r us_gov`
** EU Control Plane
+
Use the following -r flag:
+
`java -jar ./agent-certificate-renewer-{version}.jar -u <username> -p <password> -r eu1`
--
+
The command displays the following messages:
+
----
INFO: Connecting to Core Services to extract authentication token.
INFO: Connecting to Runtime Manager to request a new certificate.
INFO: Backing up current agent keystore.
INFO: Generating and saving new keystore.
