The Anypoint Runtime Manager agent publishes notifications, in JSON format, about events that occur in the Mule instance.
This enables you to implement a system for receiving and handling notifications.
Notifications are sent over both the REST and WebSocket transports.
For more information about transports, see xref:runtime-manager-agent-architecture.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Architecture].

== Configure the Agent Notifications Callback URL

To forward Runtime Manager agent notifications to a URL over the REST transport, configure a `callback` URL in the `mule-agent.yml` file.

To configure the `callback` URL:

. Add the `callback` URL to the `mule-agent.yml` file:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
transports:
  rest.agent.transport:
    enabled: true
    callback:
      url: http://localhost:8080/
    port: 8888
----
+
The values for `port` and `url` depend on the external server that will receive the notifications.
+
The configured URL must end with a trailing slash (`/`) because the agent appends the path to the URL.
. Restart Mule runtime engine.


== Application Deployment Notifications

The Runtime Manager agent sends a notification every time there is a change in state during an application deployment or undeployment. Notifications are sent via a `PUT` request to the `applications/<appname>/deployment` path:

----
PUT <callback URL>/applications/<application name>/deployment HTTP/1.1
----

=== Example Notification

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "application": {
    "name": "applicationName",
    "domain": "domainName",
    "state": "STARTED"
  },
  "status": "DEPLOYED",
  "message": "Application successfully deployed."
}
----

=== Notification Fields

Fields in each application deployment notification:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Field |Description
|`application` a|
Contains the following itemized information about the application:

* Application name
* Name of the domain to which the application is deployed
* Current state of the application

For a list of all possible application states, see the <<Application States and Deployment Status>> section.

|`status` a|
Current status of the deployment. After a deployment operation is completed, the message remains as `DEPLOYED`; after an undeployment operation the message remains as `UNDEPLOYED`.

For a list of all possible status messages, see the <<Application States and Deployment Status>> section.

|`message` |An informational message about the current deployment stage. In case of a deployment failure, information about the reason for the failure is included in the message.
|===

== Domain Deployment Notifications

The Runtime Manager agent sends a notification every time there is a change in state during a domain deployment or undeployment.

Notifications are sent via a PUT request to the `domains/<domainname>/deployment` path:

----
PUT <callback URL>/domains/<domain name>/deployment HTTP/1.1
----

=== Example Notification

[source,json,linenums]
----
"domain": {
    "name": "domainName",
    "applications": [
      {
        "name": "application1",
        "domain": "domainName",
        "state": "STARTED"
      },
      {
        "name": "application2",
        "domain": "domainName",
        "state": "STOPPED"
      },
    ]
  },
  "status": "DEPLOYED",
  "message": "Domain successfully deployed."
}
----

=== Notification Fields

Fields in each domain deployment notification:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Field |Description
|`domain` a|
Contains the following itemized information about the domain:

* Domain name
* List of applications deployed to the domain, specifying:
** Application name
** Domain name
** Application status

|`status` a|
Current status of the deployment. After a deployment operation is completed, the message remains as `DEPLOYED`; after an undeployment operation the message remains as `UNDEPLOYED`.

For a list of all possible status messages, see the <<Application States and Deployment Status>> section.

|`message` |An informational message about the current deployment stage. In case of a deployment failure, information about the reason for the failure is included in the message.
|===

== Keep-Alive Notifications

The Runtime Manager agent sends a periodic keep-alive notification to verify that the Mule instance is still running. The notification is sent via a `POST` request with an empty body to the `keepAlive` path:

----
POST <callback URL>/keepAlive HTTP/1.1
----

== Application States and Deployment Status

=== Application States

Application states represent the different stages in the lifecycle of a Mule application.

For the list of application states, see xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc#application_status_states[Application Status States].


=== Deployment Status

Deployment statuses represent the different steps for successful deployment or undeployment of an application or a domain.

For the list of valid deployment statuses, see xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc#application_deploy_states[Application Deployment States].
