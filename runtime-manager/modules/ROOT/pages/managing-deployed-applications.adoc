The basic management tools in the Runtime Manager console enable you to perform the following tasks:

* <<start_stop_delete_app,Start, stop, and delete apps>>
* <<status_states,View status states for apps>>
* <<update_application,Update apps>>

== Applications Tab

In Runtime Manager, an "application" is a Mule application that is running on a Mule runtime engine (Mule) or an API gateway runtime instance. The instance can be running in CloudHub, in an on-premises server of your organization, in a group of servers, or in a server cluster.

In the *Applications* menu, you can get a quick view of the applications that are currently deployed and running for your account. Click an entry to display additional information (as shown here), or click *Manage Application* to see the application's xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc[dashboard] and settings page:

image::amc-manageapplication.png[AMC_ManageApplication]

After you create at least one application, you can see your applications listed here.

An application deployed to a server group runs on every server in the group.

== Servers Tab

This tab is used only to deploy apps to on-premises servers. CloudHub workers aren't displayed here.

In Runtime Manager, a "server" is a Mule or API gateway instance in a location other than CloudHub (on-premises or in a different cloud server) that you must first register in the Runtime Manager console. After you register and configure your server, you can deploy your applications to it from the *Applications* tab.

image::amc-servers2.png[AMC_Servers]

From the *Servers* tab, select one of the following options to perform these tasks:

* Add a Server (registers the server with the Runtime Manager console)
* Start Mule or API gateway
* Create a server group
* Create a cluster
* Add and remove servers from a server group
* Add and remove servers from a cluster
* Stop an application on a server
* Delete a server, server group or cluster


For more about the options on this tab, see xref:managing-servers.adoc[Servers, Server Groups, and Clusters].

== Switch Environments

If you have multiple environments in your organization, you can switch between them:

. From any screen in Runtime Manager, click the current environment, which is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.
. Select the environment to switch to.
. Click *Switch*.

[[start_stop_delete_app]]
== Start, Restart, Stop, or Delete an Application

. In *Applications*, click an application name to open its management panel on the right side of the screen.
. Next to the status, click the down-arrow (the menus differ according to the app's current state):
+
image::amc-restartapp.png[AMC_StopStartDeleteApp]
+
. Click the action to perform: +
* *Start*
+
Starts stopped applications
* *Restart*
+
Resets applications that have already started. If the application is undeployed, the application's ZIP file is sent to the server to start the application on the server.
* *Stop*
+
Stops running applications.
* *Delete*
+
Deletes the application.

If youâ€™re deploying your application to an on-premises cluster, Runtime Manager starts/stops/deletes the application simultaneously on each server.

[IMPORTANT]
On CloudHub, after you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible from the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before it is purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. Open a support case at: https://help.mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Help Center] for more information.


[[status_states]]
== Status States

The information in the *Status* column depends on the context:

* <<application_status_states>>

* <<server_status_states>>
* <<server_groups_status_states>>
* <<cluster_status_states>>

[[replica_status_states]]
=== Replica Status States

Replica statuses apply only to applications deployed on Runtime Fabric. These statuses appear when you are applying new, or changed, configurations to deployed applications. See xref:runtime-fabric::app-versioning.adoc[Application Deployment Versioning].

Replica statuses include:

* *Started* (green)
+
Replica is receiving traffic.
* *Pending*

== Applications Management Panel

If you select any of the applications on the *Applications* tab, a panel opens on the right. Here you can see additional information about the application and access its settings.

image::dashboard-ch.png[dashboard]

What the management panel displays depends on whether your application is deployed on xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] or on xref:managing-applications-on-your-own-servers.adoc[your servers]:

* Applications on CloudHub display information about the CloudHub worker on which they run.
* Applications deployed on clusters and server groups display the list of servers and the status of each.

You always see the status, the time of the last modification, and the deployed application ZIP file. The *Choose File* button enables you to change the application ZIP file.

The *Manage Application* button enables you to view and configure several more application settings:

image::managing-deployed-applications-38b94.png[]

In the app's settings page, the *Dashboard* button displays the full detail dashboard for your application. See xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc[Monitoring Dashboards].

image::managing-deployed-applications-107ad.png[]

[NOTE]
The *Dashboard* option is only available for Titanium subscriptions.

The *Insight* button enables you to see data at a transaction level. See xref:insight.adoc[Insight].

image::managing-deployed-applications-76124.png[]

[NOTE]
The dashboard and insights features are not currently available for Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Options].

== Monitor Applications

The tools you use to monitor application events and server or virtual server performance depend on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment option]. See xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitor Applications].


[[update_application]]
== Update an Application

If you made changes to your application and want to deploy a new version:

. Click *Choose file* on the deployment screen.
. Select either *Import file from Exchange* or *Upload file*.
. Click *Apply changes*. +
Within a few seconds, your application redeploys. While redeploying, the application status indicator changes to blue, and then turns green after the deployment completes.
. For applications deployed to CloudHub, you can click *Logs* to see a live redeployment of your application.

If you're deploying your application to an on-premises cluster, Runtime Manager installs the new app version simultaneously on each server.

To update applications deployed to Runtime Fabric, see xref:runtime-fabric::app-versioning.adoc[Application Versioning on Runtime Fabric].

=== Grace Period

When you stop, restart, update, redeploy, or terminate an application, CloudHub tries to delete it from Mule with a timeout period of two minutes to wait for inflight messages to be delivered. After that period, CloudHub shuts down the whole instance.

== Alerts

You can set up email alerts that are sent whenever certain events occur to your application, such as deployment failures or application deletions. These alerts can be linked to a specific application or to all applications. See xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts] for information.

Even if you don't have permission to create alerts, you can specify whether to receive email alerts.

Switching an alert off from this view switches it off for the current (signed in) user only. Other users can still have active alerts.
