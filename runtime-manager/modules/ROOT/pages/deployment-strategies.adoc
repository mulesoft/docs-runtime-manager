=== Object Store

[%header,cols="15,50,40,20"]
|===
|Environment | Implementation       | Note | Reference
|CloudHub 2.0 | You do not need to configure your apps to use Object Store in CloudHub 2.0. Additionally, Mule 4 apps support Object Store v2, which can be enabled from Anypoint Runtime Manager console.  | When you enable Object Store v2 in CloudHub 2.0, note that it is rate limited.  | xref:object-store::index.adoc[Object Store v2 Overview].
|CloudHub 1.0 | CloudHub provides a preconfigured default object store that you can reference using Anypoint Connector for Object Store. | Idempotent routers work only with in-memory stores. | xref:managing-application-data-with-object-stores.adoc[Manage Application Data Storage with Object Stores].

|===

=== Scheduling

[%header,cols="15,40,40,20"]
|===
|Environment | Implementation       | Note | Reference
|CloudHub 2.0 | You can use Runtime Manager to view and control the Scheduler components within the flows in your deployed applications without changing your running application. | To view the application schedules, you must have the Exchange Viewer permission, in addition to the Read Applications permission.| xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-manage-schedules.adoc[Managing App Schedules].
|CloudHub 1.0 |You can use Runtime Manager to view and control the Scheduler components within the flows in your deployed applications.| You cannot manage CloudHub schedules using scripts.

|Runtime Fabric | When a security update is available for the runtime version for an app, you can see and apply the update in Runtime Manager.
|===

=== Shared Resource Support

[%header,cols="15,60"]
|===
|Environment | Implementation 
|CloudHub 2.0 | A shared space is an elastic cloud of resources that includes Mule instances running in a multi-tenant environment. CloudHub 2.0 provides one shared space in each supported region, to which you deploy your integration applications. See xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-shared-space-about.adoc[Shared Spaces].
|CloudHub 1.0 | Each application deployed to CloudHub runs on a separate virtual server. You don't need to use domains to share ports or other resources between apps.
|Hybrid | See <<Shared Resource Support for On-Premises App Deployments>>.

== Security for Hybrid Deployments

image:logo-cloud2-disabled.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#cloudhub-deployments", title="CloudHub 2.0"]
image:logo-cloud-disabled.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#cloudhub-deployments", title="CloudHub 1.0"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#hybrid-deployments", title="Hybrid"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#anypoint-platform-pce-deployments", title="Anypoint Platform PCE"]
image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#anypoint-runtime-fabric-deployments", title="Runtime Fabric"]

By default, only metadata pushed by the Runtime Manager agent in each Mule runtime engine flows to the cloud. No application data is exposed.

The agent monitors and controls Mule, and publishes its data to the control plane. You can control Mule from external systems by calling Runtime Manager agent APIs, or you can specify that Mule publishes its data to external systems.

You can change the default behavior so that the agent pushes IDs, final average numbers, or any data you find useful for monitoring or keeping control of applications. 
See xref:runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent].

You can also tokenize sensitive data. See xref:anypoint-security::tokenization-example.adoc[Tokenization Service Components].


== Shared Resource Support for On-Premises App Deployments

image:logo-cloud2-disabled.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#cloudhub-deployments", title="CloudHub 2.0"]
image:logo-cloud-disabled.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#cloudhub-deployments", title="CloudHub 1.0"]
image:logo-hybrid-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#hybrid-deployments", title="Hybrid"]
image:logo-server-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#anypoint-platform-pce-deployments", title="Anypoint Platform PCE"]
image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#anypoint-runtime-fabric-deployments", title="Runtime Fabric"]


When deploying on-premises, you can create `Domain` mule projects with no flows and a set of global configuration elements to share among other apps deployed to the same server.

Use this strategy to avoid configuring the same settings and credentials for each application.
You can also use it to configure multiple applications to listen on the same HTTP host and port, or other exclusive resources.

See xref:mule-runtime::shared-resources.adoc[Shared Resources].
