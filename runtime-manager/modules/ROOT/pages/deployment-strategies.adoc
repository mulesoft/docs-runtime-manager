When you run an application in Anypoint Studio, it deploys to an embedded test server in Studio. Because this server is not meant for production deployment and uptime restrictions apply, deploy your Mule applications using one of the deployment options supported by Anypoint Runtime Manager.


== CloudHub 2.0

CloudHub 2.0 is a fully managed, containerized integration platform as a service (iPaaS) where you can deploy APIs and integrations as lightweight containers in the cloud.

You can deploy your applications from the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console and host them in xref:cloudhub-2::index.adoc[CloudHub 2.0]. For more information about how to deploy applications to CloudHub 2.0, see xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-deploy.adoc[].

== CloudHub

CloudHub is a complete integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that provides server functionality for you to deploy your applications without having to configure a hosting environment. Based on your contract, you control how many resources to assign to your application.

You can deploy your applications from the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console and host them in xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub]. For more information on how to deploy applications to CloudHub, see xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[].

== Hybrid Deployments

With the hybrid deployment option, you deploy your applications from the Runtime Manager cloud console to your Mule servers and use Runtime Manager to manage them. This option provides you with flexibility and control over your on-premises security but requires you to provide the hosting infrastructure.

To use the hybrid option, you first register your Mule servers with the Runtime Manager agent. Then, from Runtime Manager, you can optionally add those servers to server groups or clusters to provide high availability. Finally, you deploy your applications from Runtime Manager to either a server, server group, or cluster.

For more information on how to deploy applications to your Mule servers, see xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[].

== Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

xref:private-cloud::index.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition] is a containerized distribution of the management and engagement capabilities of Anypoint Platform that you host on-premises or in your organization's private cloud environment.

If your organization has strict regulatory or compliance requirements that limit the use of cloud solutions, you can use Anypoint Platform PCE to deploy and host your applications on-premises.

For more information on how to deploy applications to Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, see xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[].

== Anypoint Runtime Fabric Deployments

Anypoint Runtime Fabric is a container service that automates the deployment and orchestration of Mule applications and API gateways. Runtime Fabric runs within a customer-managed infrastructure on AWS, Azure, virtual machines (VMs), and bare-metal servers.

Runtime Fabric contains all of the components it requires. These components, including Docker and Kubernetes, are optimized to work efficiently with Mule runtimes and other MuleSoft services.

To use the Runtime Fabric option, you first create a Runtime Fabric using Runtime Manager. Then, you install Runtime Fabric on your infrastructure. Finally, you deploy your applications from the Runtime Manager cloud console to the Runtime Fabric you created.

You can deploy your applications from the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console and host them in xref:runtime-fabric::index.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Fabric]. For more information on how to deploy applications to Runtime Fabric, see xref:runtime-fabric::deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[].

|CloudHub 2.0 | A shared space is an elastic cloud of resources that includes Mule instances running in a multi-tenant environment. CloudHub 2.0 provides one shared space in each supported region, to which you deploy your integration applications. |  xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-shared-space-about.adoc[]
|CloudHub | Each application deployed to CloudHub runs on a separate virtual server. You don't need to use domains to share ports or other resources between applications.|
|Hybrid | When deploying on-premises, you can create `Domain` mule projects with no flows and a set of global configuration elements to share among other applications deployed to the same server. | <<Shared Resource Support for On-Premises App Deployments>>

To obtain the health status of the cluster and components, use Runtime Fabric command-line tools. See xref:runtime-fabric::manage-monitor-applications.adoc[Monitoring Applications Deployed to Runtime Fabric].
|===


=== Horizontal Autoscaling 

image:logo-cloud2-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#cloudhub-2-deployments", title="CloudHub 2.0"]

Horizontal autoscaling makes Mule apps deployed to CloudHub 2.0 responsive to CPU usage by automatically scaling up or down replica capacity as needed. In Kubernetes, a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically updates a workload resource to automatically match demand.

* CloudHub 2.0: xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-configure-horizontal-autoscaling.adoc[]
* Runtime Fabric: xref:runtime-fabric::configure-horizontal-autoscaling.adoc[]


== Security for Hybrid Deployments

image:logo-hybrid-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#hybrid-deployments", title="Hybrid"]

By default, only metadata pushed by the Runtime Manager agent in each Mule runtime engine flows to the cloud. No application data is exposed.

The agent monitors and controls Mule, and publishes its data to the control plane. You can control Mule from external systems by calling Runtime Manager agent APIs, or you can specify that Mule publishes its data to external systems.

You can change the default behavior so that the agent pushes IDs, final average numbers, or any data you find useful for monitoring or keeping control of applications.
See xref:runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent].

You can also tokenize sensitive data. See xref:anypoint-security::tokenization-from-a-mule.adoc[Expose Tokenization as a Service Directly to Mule Applications].


== Shared Resource Support for On-Premises App Deployments

image:logo-hybrid-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#hybrid-deployments", title="Hybrid"]
image:logo-server-active.png[xref="deployment-strategies.adoc#anypoint-platform-pce-deployments", title="Anypoint Platform PCE"]


When deploying on-premises, you can create `Domain` mule projects with no flows and a set of global configuration elements to share among other applications deployed to the same server.

Use this strategy to avoid configuring the same settings and credentials for each application.
You can also use it to configure multiple applications to listen on the same HTTP host and port, or other exclusive resources.

See xref:mule-runtime::shared-resources.adoc[Shared Resources].
