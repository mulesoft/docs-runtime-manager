When you run an app in Anypoint Studio, the app deploys to an embedded test server in Studio. Because this server is not meant for production deployment and uptime restrictions apply, deploy your Mule app using one of the deployment options supported by Anypoint Runtime Manager.

== High Availability

// Brief description?

[%header,cols="15,35,50,30"]
|===
|Environment | Implementation               | Additional Features      | Reference
|CloudHub 2.0 |    |   |
|CloudHub 1.0 |Clustering, which includes load balancing, persistent message queues, and horizontal scaleout. | Active monitoring of services and workers for problem and issue solving. | xref:cloudhub-fabric.adoc[Clustering].
|Hybrid | Server groups or clusters. |Clustered Mule instances have distributed shared memory, which provides persistent VM queues, transactions, and cluster-wide data storage. | xref:server-group-about.adoc[Server Groups], xref:cluster-about.adoc[Clusters], and xref:mule-runtime::mule-high-availability-ha-clusters.adoc[Mule Runtime High Availability (HA) Cluster Overview].
|Private Cloud Edition | Server groups or clusters. |Clustered Mule instances have distributed shared memory, which provides persistent VM queues, transactions, and cluster-wide data storage. | xref:server-group-about.adoc[Server Groups], xref:cluster-about.adoc[Clusters], and xref:mule-runtime::mule-high-availability-ha-clusters.adoc[Mule Runtime High Availability (HA) Cluster Overview].
|Runtime Fabric | Automatic application fail-over. | High availability when you deploy two or more replicas per application. | xref:runtime-fabric::deploy-resource-allocation.adoc[Deploy a Mule Application to Runtime Fabric].

== JDK Versions

// Brief description?

[%header,cols="15,45,45"]
|===
|Environment | Version         | Reference
|CloudHub 2.0 |                   |
|CloudHub 1.0 |JDK 8, for all applications built with Mule runtime 3.9.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x and later. | xref:release-notes::cloudhub/cloudhub-runtimes-release-notes.adoc[CloudHub Runtime and Operating System Release Notes].
|Hybrid | See the  Mule runtime engine release notes to determine the minimum JDK supported version. | xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mule-esb.adoc[Mule Runtime Release Notes].
|Private Cloud Edition | See the  Mule runtime engine release notes to determine the minimum JDK supported version. |xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mule-esb.adoc[Mule Runtime Release Notes].

== Load Balancing

// Brief description?

[%header,cols="15,35,65"]
|===
|Environment | Supported Load Balancing        | Alternative / Workaround
|CloudHub 2.0 |  |
|CloudHub 1.0 | If your app runs on multiple workers, the CloudHub 1.0 shared load automatically balances incoming traffic.  | Use the optional dedicated load balancer (DLB) component to
route external traffic to multiple Mule applications deployed to CloudHub workers in Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
|Hybrid | Not Supported.  | You can manage load balancing with the tools connected to your on-premises resources.
|Private Cloud Edition | Not Supported. | You can manage load balancing with the tools connected to your on-premises resources.
|Runtime Fabric |  Internal load balancer for basic load balancing. | You can also forward logs from Runtime Fabric to a rsyslog server.

== Logging

// Brief description?

[%header,cols="15,50,40,35"]
|===
|Environment | Description       | Alternative / Workaround | Reference
|CloudHub 2.0 |                  |                          |
|CloudHub 1.0 | CloudHub 1.0 provides a logging service for customizing log levels, searching logs, and downloading logs. |   | xref:viewing-log-data.adoc[View Log Data].
|Hybrid | The Runtime Manager logging feature is not available for hybrid deployments. | You can configure on-premises apps to send data to external analytics tools, such as Splunk or ELK, to manage your logs. | xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[Export Data to External Analytics Tools].
|Private Cloud Edition | The Runtime Manager logging feature is not available for hybrid deployments. | The Runtime Manager logging feature is not available for hybrid deployments. | xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[Export Data to External Analytics Tools].
|Runtime Fabric | Runtime Fabric supports Anypoint Monitoring Titanium logging.  | You can also forward logs from Runtime Fabric to a rsyslog server. | xref:runtime-fabric::runtime-fabric-logs.adoc[View and Configure Logging in Runtime Fabric].
