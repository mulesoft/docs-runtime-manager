You can use Runtime Manager to view and control the Scheduler components within the flows in your deployed applications.
Use the *Schedulers* tab in the navigation menu to enable or disable Scheduler elements, change the frequency, or run the scheduled job immediately, all without changing the running application.

[NOTE]
Schedule management is supported on servers in a hybrid deployment environment using only Mule version 3.9 or later.

From the *Schedulers* tab, you can:

* Enable or disable the Scheduler
* Change the frequency
* Specify when to start running the Scheduler
* Specify the timezone for a cron Scheduler


Runtime Manager lists the name of each Scheduler component as `polling://{flow_name}`.

== Use Cases

Schedule management is useful in the following contexts:

* You want to change the schedulers in your application at runtime without redeploying.
* You want to disable a scheduled job while one of the applications you are connecting to is undergoing maintenance.
* You want runtime visibility into the schedulers in your application.


== Considerations and Limitations

When using the *Schedulers* tab, consider the following:

* If a scheduled job is not triggered because the application is not running,
Runtime Manager triggers the job as soon as the application restarts.
* The scheduler reads the job configuration every time it runs.
+
To apply your changes immediately, run your jobs manually after updating the schedule.



== View and Manage Application Schedulers in Runtime Manager

To use the scheduling feature in Runtime Manager, deploy an application that includes one or more Scheduler elements:

.The arrow shows the *Scheduler* component in the Anypoint Studio canvas.
