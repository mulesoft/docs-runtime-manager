Use Runtime Manager to register and set up the properties of servers, server groups, and clusters that reside on-premises. After setting up a server, you can add it to a server group or cluster. Then, select the server, group, or cluster as the deployment target for your applications.

== Server Groups and Clusters

Both server groups and clusters run applications in multiple distributed nodes. When using a server group, instances of the applications are completely isolated from each other. In a cluster configuration, the nodes are aware of one another and share common information and synchronize statuses.

All servers in a server group or clusters must have the same Mule runtime engine version and Runtime Manager agent version.

== Alerts

You can set up email alerts to notify you when events occur on your servers, such as a server being disconnected or a server being removed from a cluster. You can link alerts to a specific server or to all of the servers in the server group or cluster.
