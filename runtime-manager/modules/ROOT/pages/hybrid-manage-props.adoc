In an on-premises (hybrid or Anypoint Platform PCE) deployment, you can add properties to an application by using either a properties file or Anypoint Runtime Manager.

For example, you can define application-specific properties in a properties file and then later add environment-specific properties from Runtime Manager during deployment.

Specifying properties in Runtime Manager enables you to define an application's properties in one place rather than in multiple files in multiple environments.

After deploying an application, you can modify application properties or create new ones from the application *Settings* page.
If you change properties after an application is deployed, you must restart the application and any server group or cluster where the application is deployed.

The values of properties defined on the *Settings* page override any application properties defined in the properties file or other properties of Mule.

The following security considerations apply to properties:

* Values sent between Runtime Manager and Mule runtime engine are encrypted over HTTPS.
* Values stored in the Runtime Manager internal database are encrypted.
* Runtime Manager displays the values of the properties only in the *Settings* page.


== Add Application Properties by Using a Properties File

You can add properties to an app by including a file in the deployable application archive file:

* Property placeholder YAML file (Mule 4)
+
See xref:mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties].
* `mule-app.properties` (Mule 3)
+
See xref:3.9@mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties].

Mule runtime engine then loads these properties into the application when the application starts.

== Add Application Properties in Runtime Manager

You can override the property values in the properties file bundled inside the application in Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Applications* tab.
. Click the *Status* column to display the details pane.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Properties* tab, (*2*) the *Key* and *Value* fields, and (*3*) the *...* menu on the application *Settings* page.

. Enter the property name in the *Key* field.
. Enter the property value in the *Value* field.
. Click *Save* > *Redeploy Application*.

You can edit or delete a property using options in the *...* menu.


== Other Methods for Overriding App Properties

The following are some alternative methods for overriding app properties:

* Configure an external location to add property placeholders or secure property placeholder files to override properties.

* Set Java system environment variables at deployment time to override properties.
+
To do this, deploy the app using the following command:
+
----
mule -M-Dsecret.key=toSecretPassword -M-Denv=prod -M-Ddb.password=secretPassword -app myApp.zip
----
+
In this case, all the values typed into the command are stored only in memory and must be provided every time. The values are never stored in any file.
