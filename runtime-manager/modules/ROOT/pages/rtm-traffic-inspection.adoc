The Traffic Inspection feature for Mule instances adds support to the Runtime Manager agent for a forward proxy that is deployed in your environment. This proxy acts as a man-in-the-middle between Mule and the control plane, intercepting and inspecting all HTTPS traffic. 

== Prerequisites 

=== Traffic Inspection Proxy

* An HTTP Inspection Proxy is required with support for TLS connections to the runtime client and mTLS connections to the control plane server.
* The inspection proxy server does not require the Runtime Manager agent to present a client certificate. Communication between the agent and the inspection proxy is TLS, not mTLS.
* The inspection proxy must be provisioned to send a customer-private certificate to the Runtime Manager agent. The agent uses a Certificate Authority from the JVM's keystore to validate the public certificate presented by the inspection proxy.
* The inspection proxy and the MuleSoft control plane communicate via mTLS. The two certificates involved are:
** The control plane presents a MuleSoft public server certificate to the inspection proxy. The proxy must be provisioned with the correct Certificate Authority to validate the server certificate presented by the MuleSoft control plane.
** The control plane requires a client certificate from the inspection proxy. The customer must provide this certificate to to MuleSoft. 
+
[NOTE]
Communication with the control plane fails if the certificate does not match the specified serial number and common name.

== Install and Register Mule

=== Provision the Truststore of the JVM with the Proxy Root CA

. Identify the folder location of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
. Insert the root CA of the proxy in the truststore of the Mule JVM:
+
In the terminal window, run the following command, replacing `$JAVA_HOME` with the actual path:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
sudo keytool -import -alias testCert -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file proxy_cacert.pem
----
+
. Enter the provided password.
. If you have multiple versions of Java, insert the certificate in the version of Java that the Mule instance uses.

[[install-mule-runtime]]
=== Install Mule Runtime

. Install the latest available Mule runtime version. You can skip this step if already installed.
+
To check the latest Mule version, see xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mule-esb.adoc[].
+
[NOTE] 
The Mule runtime installation bundle includes both Mule runtime engine and the Runtime Manager agent. 

=== Upgrade the Runtime Manager Agent

Make sure that the version of Runtime Manager agent is 2.5.6 or later. If you have an earlier version, update the agent before registering by following these steps:

. Download the `agent-setup-2.5.6.zip` file.
. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to `$MULE_HOME/bin`.
. If prompted, overwrite any conflicting files. 
+ 
Do not run `amc_setup -U`.

=== Register Mule

. Update the `wrapper.conf` file with the IP and port of the traffic inspection proxy by following the instructions in xref:rtm-agent-proxy-config.adoc#set-up-proxy-server-configuration-in-the-wrapper-conf-file[Set Up Proxy Server Configuration in the wrapper.conf File].
. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager* > *Servers*.
. Click *Add Server*.
+

+
. In a terminal window, change the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory to the Mule instance that you're registering.
. Paste the command on the command line and append the proxy's IP address or domain name and port, and the `--enable-traffic-inspection` configuration flag. 
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
./amc_setup -H {registrationToken} {serverName} -P {proxy ip or hostname} {proxyPort} --enable-traffic-inspection
----
+
[NOTE]
Make sure to leave a space between the proxy's domain name and port number.
+
. Confirm that the Mule instance registered successfully. The runtime should appear as *Created* in the Anypoint Platform console:
+
image::mule-registered.png[The Mule instance appears as created]
+
. Edit the file `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` and set the property `authenticationProxy.endpoint` to `null`.
. Start the Mule instance.

=== Check that the Mule Runtime is Connected to the Control Plane

If the connection is successful, you should see the runtime with status *Running* in the Anypoint console:

Also, if the connection has been established, the Mule agent terminal window displays the following message:

[source,console,linenums]
----

----

== Notes

* For agent version 2.5.6, you cannot renew mule certificates from Runtime Manager. If you need to renew your certificates, follow the instructions in xref:servers-cert-renewal.adoc#renew-a-certificate-via-the-command-line[Renew a Certificate via the Command Line]. 
** Use version `2.4.37` of the application. 
** Certificates are valid for 2 years out of the box.
* To enable traffic inspection, the Mule runtime and agent must be installed from scratch as per instructions in this document. Upgrading from a standalone Mule deployed in a PCE environment is not supported.
** Using a runtime version earlier than the one specified in <<install-mule-runtime>> might result in some functionality not working as expected.
