After you deploy your application, use the monitoring dashboards in Runtime Manager to monitor the application's performance. If you deployed the application to an on-premises server, you can also monitor the server.

Depending on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment option] you use, different monitoring resources are available, including alerts, dashboards, notifications, and flow metrics.

[NOTE]
For CloudHub 2.0 deployments, the Runtime Manager monitoring feature is available for applications only. For more information, see xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-monitor-apps.adoc[Monitoring Apps Deployed to CloudHub 2.0].

== Monitoring Servers

On applications that are deployed on-premises, use the following tools to get information about the servers.

Send e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.
