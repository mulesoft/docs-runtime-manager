This document describes Anypoint Platform settings relevant to applications deployed to CloudHub.

Manage these settings from the xref:access-management::index.adoc[*Access Management*] in your Anypoint Platform.

[NOTE]
Your account must have the role *Cloudhub administrator* or *Organization Administrator* to edit access management settings.

== Manage Regions

If Global Deployment is enabled on your account, you can also set the default region. The region auto-populates in the deployment screen settings for all applications deployed by users in your organization, and it can be adjusted at the application level if necessary for individual deployments.

Access this menu by clicking the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then picking the *CloudHub* link, under *Settings* in the left menu.

[NOTE]
If you don't currently have Global Deployment enabled on your account but would like it, please contact your MuleSoft account manager.

See xref:cloudhub-networking-guide.adoc#regional-services[Regional Services] for a list of available regions.

== CloudHub Subscription

When you first sign up for CloudHub, you're automatically added to the Free plan (subscription level). To upgrade to a paid plan, please contact your MuleSoft account manager.

To see your subscription level and usage, click the gear icon at the top of the screen and click *Subscription*:

--
The number of workers is not the same as the number of applications.
For more information about worker sizing, see xref:cloudhub-fabric.adoc[High Availability] and xref:cloudhub-architecture.adoc#cloudhub-workers[CloudHub Workers].
--

Only running applications count for vCores processing usage. `Stopped` applications do not consume vCore availability.

== Changing Your Plan

To change your plan, you can contact your account representative or your Customer Success Manager.
