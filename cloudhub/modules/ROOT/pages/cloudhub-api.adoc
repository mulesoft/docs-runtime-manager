The CloudHub management API (CloudHub API) enables you to programmatically access the functions of Anypoint Runtime Manager, such as:

* Manage applications:
** Create, deploy, start, stop, list, and delete an application on CloudHub.
** Update application metadata, including the number of workers, Mule runtime engine version, and system properties.
** Retrieve statistics for an application or worker.

** Check for replay data, replay the flow for a transaction, and delete replay data for an application.
** Manage static IP addresses and release unused IP addresses associated with an application.
** Download the Mule package file for the application.
** Update, enable, disable, or run all or some schedules.


* Manage logs, notifications, and alerts:
** Add, update, or retrieve log levels for an application.
** Download the log file for an application or instance.

For an interactive reference that includes supported resources, methods, required properties, and expected responses, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/cloudhub-api/[CloudHub API].

The CloudHub API manages only applications deployed to CloudHub, the cloud-based version of Runtime Manager.
To manage on-premises applications using the API, see https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/arm-rest-services[Runtime Manager REST Services].


== Use the CloudHub API

Before getting started, familiarize yourself with operations for applications.

You can use any HTTP client with the CloudHub API.
With Java, use the https://jersey.github.io/[Jersey client] or http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html[HttpClient] with https://github.com/codehaus/jackson[Jackson] for JSON support.

The CloudHub API specification is pulished in https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/cloudhub-api/minor/1.0/pages/home/[MuleSoft's developer portal]. After going through this quick start guide refer to this resource for more details.

To access operations in the CloudHub API, you must:

include::partial$api-authenticate.adoc[]

=== Get a List of Applications

To get a list of apps deployed to CloudHub, run the following `curl` command:

----
curl -X GET \
  --url https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/applications \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-ANYPNT-ENV-ID: ENV_ID' \
  -H 'X-ANYPNT-ORG-ID: ORG_ID'
----


== Data Format

Resources and methods that return or accept a type use the JSON data format.
Here is an example of data received in JSON format in response to a request to get an application:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "versionId": "xxxxxxxx",
  "domain": "hello",
  "fullDomain": "hello.us-e1.cloudhub.io",
  "properties": {
    "foo":"bar"
  },
  "propertiesOptions": {},
  "status": "STARTED",
  "workers": {
    "type": {
      "name": "Micro",
      "weight": 0.1,
      "cpu": "0.1 vCores",
      "memory": "500 MB memory"
    },
    "amount": 1,
    "remainingOrgWorkers": 223.7,
    "totalOrgWorkers": 1000.0
  },
  "workerStatuses": [
    {
      "id": "i-xxxxxxxx",
      "host": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
      "port": 0,
      "status": "STARTED",
      "deployedRegion": "us-east-1",
      "staticIPEnabled": false
    }
  ],
  "lastUpdateTime": 1589868960908,
  "fileName": "hello.zip",
  "muleVersion": {
    "version": "4.3.0",
    "updateId": "xxxxxxxx",
    "latestUpdateId": "xxxxxxxx",
    "endOfSupportDate": 1633737600000
  },
  ...
}
----

=== The `{domain}` parameter

For most of the API calls that deal with a single application you will be requested to provide its domain, for example when requesting application details:
 `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/v2/applications/{domain}`

This domain is the uniquie application name, part of the full fomain that will be used to cosume your application.
If you are not sure what is the domain value for a particular application follow the link:#get-a-list-of-applications[example] above to retrieve application list and refer to the `domain` field in the output.

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "versionId": "xxxxxxxx",
  "domain": "hello",
  ...
}
----

== Rate Limits

The CloudHub management API enforces global usage limits, with some exceptions.


=== Global Rate Limits for the CloudHub Management API

The following table lists the rate limits for the CloudHub management API endpoints except those listed in <<Exceptions to the Global Rate Limits>>.

When the app reaches the rate limit, CloudHub returns a 503 status code.

[%header,cols="20,20,20,10"]
|===
|Endpoints |Control Plane | Rate Limit Per Client IP Address | Status Code
.3+|All except specified endpoints|U.S.|75 requests per second  .3+| `503`
|EU .2+| 25 requests per second
|Government Cloud
|===


=== Exceptions to the Global Rate Limits

The following table lists the exceptions to the <<Global Rate Limits for the CloudHub Management API>>.

When the app reaches the rate limit, CloudHub returns the status codes shown here.

[%header,cols="20,20,20,10"]
|===
|Endpoints|Control Plane | Rate Limit Per Client IP Address| Status Code
4+|*Endpoints under* `/api`
.3+|`/notifications`|U.S.|75 requests per minute .3+| `503`
|EU .2+|25 requests per minute
|Government Cloud
4+|*Endpoints under* `*v2/applications/{domain}*`
|`/logs` .4+|All .3+|10 requests per second  .3+| `429`
|`/deployments/{deploymentId}/logs`
|`/instances/{instanceId}/logs`
|`/instances/{instanceId}/log-file`|1 request per minute  | `500`
|===



== Status Codes and Error Handling

When you call the CloudHub API, the following status codes are returned:

[%header,cols="10a,50a"]
|===
|Status Code |Description
|200 |The operation was successful.
|201 |The resource (such as an application) was created.

The `Location` header contains the location of the resource.
|404 |The resource was not found.
|409 |When creating a resource (such as a server, server group, or deployment), a resource with that name already exists.
|429 a|The operation was unsuccessful due to reaching the rate limit.
|500 |The operation was unsuccessful.

See the HTTP body for details.
|503 |The operation was unsuccessful due to a temporary condition, such as server overload or reaching a rate limit.

Retry the operation.
|===

When errors occur, such as a 500 status code, the HTTP response contains a JSON response with an error message:

[source,json,linenums]
----
500
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Date: Mon, 10 Aug 2015 00:12:55 GMT

{
  message : "Some error message."
}
----
